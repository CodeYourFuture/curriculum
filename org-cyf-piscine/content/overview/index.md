The Piscine is an assessment. The goal is not to learn new things (though people will!), but to test understanding gained so far.

The Piscine is intended to be completed after the [Intro to Programming](https://programming.codeyourfuture.io/overview/) and tests the knowledge gained in that course.

The Piscine acts as an entry test to join the [Software Development Course](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/overview/).

Each week, trainees:
* Build an assessed project to a strict spec, either in a group or individually (they will do both).
* Give an assessed demo about their work.

At the end of the Piscine, trainees do an interview where they must, among other things, explain their code and show that they understand it.
