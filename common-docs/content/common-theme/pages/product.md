In our current curriculum, each module should have a module-length project that produces a tangible product. These products form a starting point for trainee portfolios, and are mandatory for progression. They are always put together in a dedicated project repository and that is the source of truth.

So the instructions are generally pulled from the project repo, the backlog the same. Basically set up the project repo with a README and issues, and then assign that content in the front matter to _mirror_ the project here.
