This is just a single. You can use this to create a basic page. Most of the pages in /guides are singles, but the module views have _no_ singles. They are composed from blocks and this is the core design principle of the theme.

The composable and re-arrangeable nature of blocks allows us to continually refine and reorganise the curriculum in response to the needs of our community and the demands of the market. This is crucial for our ability to manage change and keep the curriculum up-to-date as a grassroots volunteer org with only _one_ technical person on staff _worldwide_ managing ~10 different curricula across 6 regions. So please don't gob loads of content into singles. She won't thank you. Use blocks instead.
