These pages are built from [Hugo archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) stored in the theme /archetypes directory. Each archetype comes preloaded with example usage of the blocks system. You can use these examples to build your own pages.

There's an included bash script which will generate an entire module structure for you. It will create the necessary directories and [markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and populate them with the correct front matter directly from the archetypes. It's stored in `curriculum/tooling/create_module.sh`
