[Shortcodes can be used in markdown copy.](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) This means you can render chunks of custom code inside the markdown render loop. This is useful for creating reusable components that can be used in multiple places. The syntax for invoking a shortcode is `{{` `< shortcode-name >` `}}`. The shortcode name is the name of the file in the `layouts/shortcodes` directory.
