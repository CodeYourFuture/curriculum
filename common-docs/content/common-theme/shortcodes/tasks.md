Tasks are learning objectives you want to render but not track. They will be rendered on Hugo and GitHub as task lists. They will be shown in the learning objectives section on a block. But they will NOT be tracked as learning objectives and won't be passed to the success criteria of a sprint.

> [!TIP]
> You probably want [objectives](./objectives) instead.
