Another [codefence render hook](https://gohugo.io/render-hooks/code-blocks/). Add runkit to a page by adding the word `runkit` after the three backticks. This will [render a Runkit](https://runkit.com/home) on the page. You can embed a REPL _with_ npm packages and endpoints.

Don't create loads of these on a page, they're heavy.
