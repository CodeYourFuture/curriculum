### Invoke

...with three backticks and the word "mermaid" on the first line - theres no obvious way to escape this, sorry.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge develop
    commit
    commit
```

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) [works on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams), too, and any diagrams you write in a readme or issue will render here too. There're flowcharts, sequence diagrams, gantt charts, mindmaps, and more.
