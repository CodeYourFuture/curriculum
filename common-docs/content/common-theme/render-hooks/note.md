This is a [blockquote render hook](https://gohugo.io/render-hooks/blockquotes/#alerts) to render [Github style notes](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-new-markdown-extension-alerts-provide-distinctive-styling-for-significant-content/). If you mark up a note on GitHub, it will also render in Common.

It actually doesn't produce a blockquote when you invoke it because that is shonky semantics. It produces a section.

The markdown operation of normal blockquotes is unhindered and unchanged.
