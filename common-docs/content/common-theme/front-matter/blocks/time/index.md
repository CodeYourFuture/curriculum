```toml
time = 60
```

This is the time in minutes that a block will take. It's used in the day plan to build a schedule, and in the prep view to help learners schedule their learning. Time is very important to our learners, as many people are fitting learning around other commitments, including multiple jobs, childcare, and other responsibilities. If we are asking someone to do an activity, we must be clear about how long it will take, so they can find that time.
