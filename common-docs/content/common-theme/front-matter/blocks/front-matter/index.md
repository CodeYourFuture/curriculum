[Front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) is metadata that is added to the top of a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file. It is used to provide information about the content of the file. It's common to all {{<tooltip title="SSGs">}}Static Site Generators: SSG.
Common theme is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/). {{</tooltip>}}

Hugo comes with a load of built-in front matter variables that you can use to customise your content.

These docs just cover settings custom to the Common Theme. For a full list of Hugo front matter variables, see the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
