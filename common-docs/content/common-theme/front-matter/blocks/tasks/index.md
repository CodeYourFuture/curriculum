```toml
tasks = ["Write objectives you can measure", "Tasks are objectives that aren't passed to success view or overviews"]
```

This is a list of tasks for a block. They look the same as learning objectives and should be formulated in the same way. However, tasks will not show up in the success view for any sprint this block is added to. They will only show up on the block itself when rendered on to a page.

Structured objectives are important for organising and focusing the learning time of our community. But repetitive or purely operational tasks like "Nominate a timekeeper" or "Take a break" don't need to be collated and tracked by the learner like objectives do. They are just tasks that need to be done to complete the activity.
