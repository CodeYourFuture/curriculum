Just like the theme is a Hugo module, so is the content. This means that we can mount content from other repositories into this site. This is how we can share content between different sites, and how we can use the same content in different ways.

There's a common module for all common content, but you can also hive off content into separate modules. For example, the PD team has their own module for their curriculum content. Each individual course is also its own Hugo module, so they can be composed into different programmes and combinations.

Basically, it's blocks all the way down.
