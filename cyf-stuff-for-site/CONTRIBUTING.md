# Contribution Guide

## Welcome to the CYF Curriculum

We are a volunteer-led community of tech professionals, and we teach people to code for free. We are majority-minority, we welcome everyone, and we welcome _you_.

This curriculum compiles narratives and activities developed by hundreds of people all over the world. You are invited to join us.

## Who runs this?

The Global Syllabus Team is a group of long term CYF volunteers who are responsible for the overall direction of the curriculum. All Tech Ed volunteers can, and do, develop content for the curriculum, but the Global Syllabus Team decide the strategy and accept new content into the core.

This team is led by the Director of Education, currently [Sally McGrath](https://github.com/SallyMcGrath). We meet every two weeks to discuss the curriculum and make decisions. The agenda is posted in the CYF Slack channel #cyf-syllabus-tech and the minutes are posted on this website. If you'd like to come and talk to us, please do!

## What content?

### Our content is:

- practical
- written in simple English at a maximum of CEFR B2
- free

### Our content is not:

- a textbook
- a reference manual
- a collection of tutorials

## How to contribute

### Propose a new narrative or activity

We adopt _tested_ content into the main curriculum, so develop and try out your material first! Come to class, try it, and get feedback from the community. Come talk in #cyf-syllabus-tech on Slack and iterate on your session.

1. Develop your narrative or activity in a CYF repo.
2. If you're recording a video, upload it to YouTube and make it public.
3. Use your material and iterate on it with trainees.
4. When you're ready to propose adoption, open a PR to this repo, and choose the adoption PR template.
5. The Global Tech Ed team will consider your proposal and give you feedback.

**We like to experiment.** If you have an idea, try it out and let us know how it goes! Keep your experiments small and test them early. (If you want to try something big, like a new module, come talk to us first.)

Our curriculum threads a coherent line through all of this activity, so whatever worlds we explore, we can all come back here and find out _what_ to do _next_.

_Most_ content we develop and use with classes will not be adopted into the core curriculum -- that's ok! We want to be free to experiment.

## Pedagogy

We use the [Teach Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/) pedagogical framework.

## Bugs

If you spot a bug, please let us know by [creating an issue]() or opening a PR with the fix. Bug fixes are super welcome!

As this front end composes many different repos, please open an issue in the repo where you found the bug. If you're not sure, open an issue in this [main repo]().

(If the content is pulled from another repo, there's a link next to the heading -- follow that link to the source repo and open an issue there.)
