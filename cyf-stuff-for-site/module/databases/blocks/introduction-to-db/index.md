A database is a structured set of data held in a computer. It provides ways to store, retrieve and organize information.

### Why do we need them?

In the past few weeks, you stored and retrieved data using files. This is fine for simple data but it can quickly become an issue as your application becomes more complex and needs to store and manipulate more complicated data. For example, imagine you are asked to develop a booking system for a medium-sized hotel. You will need to store the list of rooms available for booking, and as you add more features, you will need to save users information, the reviews they post, the bookings each user makes and payment information. You can see that the data you need to handle can become very complicated, especially when you need to consider that data are not static, as they can be updated or deleted. To work more effectively with data, we can then use a database, which presents the following benefits:

- A database defines a structure for your data and the relationships between entities
- A database provides convenient and performant ways to safely store and retrieve data
- A database provides a mechanism to check the validity of your data

### Different types of database

There are many different kinds of database and different implementations. Sometimes, a database type is a better fit to certain use case or certain problems. The most well-known database types include relational database, key/value database, graph database and document database (also known as NoSQL). For this class, we will focus specifically on relational database as they are the most widely used and supported. You can consult [DB-Engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) to see a ranking of the most used database, as you can see, there are a lot of them!
