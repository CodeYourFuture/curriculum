It's important that software works and that other people can _use_ it

Today we will spend most of our time working together on our projects in timed bursts of 25 minutes. This is called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), and it will help you manage your self study. On the 5 minute break, get up from your computer and move your body: stretch! This is hard work. We will develop and then ship our code repeatedly throughout the day. Each time we ship, we will ship something that works.

- Pick one of the CYF Blocks projects and ship it to your website
- Choose a way to improve upon the project to make it better suited to your website. Modify your CYF Blocks implementation then ship it!
- Get feedback from one of your peers: what new requirement would they like to add? Can you implement this in CYF Blocks? Ship it again!

How will you work together? Using the collaborative tools you have learned during this course:

## You are part of a cohort

- **together**: identify your blockers
- **in small groups**: define your goals as user stories
- **in pairs**: iteratively improve your products
