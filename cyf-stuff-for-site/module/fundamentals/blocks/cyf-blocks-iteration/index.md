Now we have started to think about the idea of MVP, how can we use this to help us build _working_ software?

{{<note type="tip" title="Tip">}}
It's important that software _works_ and that we _and other people_ can _use_ it!
{{</note>}}

In software development, we start with the smallest, simplest thing we can build _that works_. Then we _incrementally_ improve it. This is **iteration**.

You all built a personal home page in Intro to Digital, and last week you shipped it. Now let's iterate on your websites.

{{<note type="activity" title="Point (10m)">}}

In pairs, define some user stories for your own websites, to improve it. These should be:

- a small change
- that is achievable with the CYF Blocks seen in the course so far
- but a complete feature
- try for at least one feature that updates or changes the page when an action is taken (e.g. clicking when a button)

Read ahead to Ship It to see where to paste your code.

{{<note type="activity" title="Click! (25m)">}}
In the same pairs, try to implement one user story. While implementing, try to break down into steps where you can visually check that your code runs as expected.
