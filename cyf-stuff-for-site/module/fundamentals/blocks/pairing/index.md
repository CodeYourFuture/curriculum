It's good to code with a friend. You learn SO much. Programmers call this pair programming and many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day. Mentors will demonstrate pairing now.

{{<note type="activity" title="Pairing (20 minutes)">}}

In pairs, iteratively develop a solution to the CYF Blocks problem you are given.

- Switch between driver and navigator roles after 10 minutes
- The "driver" is the person typing on the keyboard, just thinking about what needs to be written
- The "navigator" reviews what the driver is doing and is thinking about to write next
- Don't dominate - this is teamwork
