We want to use computers without understanding _exactly_ how they are built. Every day we ask machines to do things, and usually we have no idea how these machines work. We could not use modern technology if we had to understand it completely before we could use it; it would take too long! Instead we use {{<tooltip title="interfaces">}}Think of an **interface** as a gate that allows communication between a user and a machine.
The user asks the machine to do things via the interface.{{</tooltip>}}

Think about a cash machine (ATM). We go to a hole in the wall with a screen and a keypad. The **screen and the keypad** are the user interface. We press the buttons and ask the machine to do things - like giving our balance, or withdrawing some money from an account.
