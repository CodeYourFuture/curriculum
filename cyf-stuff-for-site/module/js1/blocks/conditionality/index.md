> Recall: JavaScript programs are built up from sequences of **declarations** and **statements**.

In programming, we can use an **`if` statement** to execute some code when a given condition is `true`. In JavaScript, we can write an `if` statement as follows:

```js {title="main.js"}
if (condition) {
  // do some code in here
}
```

The `if` statement consists of:

1. `if` keyword: this is the start of the `if` statement
2. `(condition)`: condition is an expression that evaluates to true or false
3. `{}`: a block statement: any code we want to execute if the condition is true goes inside the curly braces here

We can represent this with a diagram too:

```mermaid

    IC{condition}
    IB[Execute code in body]
    EXIT([End of if statement])
    IC --> |true| IB
    IC -.-> |false| EXIT
    IB --> EXIT
```

```js
function checkDivisibility(a, b) {
  if (a % b === 0) {
    return `${a} is divisible by ${b}`;
  }

  return `${a} is not divisible by ${b}`;
}

console.log(checkDivisibility(10, 2));
console.log(checkDivisibility(50, 3));
```

Play computer with the example above, step through each line in the code and work out happens each time the function is called.

- What is the **return value** each time the function is called?
- What value is assigned to the `phoneNumber` **parameter** each time the function is called?

If you've not encountered any syntax before, remember to look it up in some documentation.

### üïπÔ∏è Playing computer

```js
function getCountryCode(phoneNumber) {
  if (phoneNumber.startsWith("+44")) {
    return "UK";
  }
}

getCountryCode("+447831620328");
getCountryCode("+989871783972");
```

Play computer with the example above, step through each line in the code and work out happens each time the function is called.

- What is the **return value** each time the function is called?
- What value is assigned to the `phoneNumber` parameter each time the function is called?
- Try describing the purpose of this function - what should it do?
