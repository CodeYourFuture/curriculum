> üéØ Sub-goal: Build a film card component

To break down this problem, we'll render a single datum, before doing this for the whole list. Here's one film:

```js
const film = {
  title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
  director: "Martin Scorsese",
  times: ["15:35"],
  certificate: "15",
  duration: 112,
};
```

Starting with this object, we'll focus _only_ on building this section of the user interface:

<details>
<summary> üñºÔ∏è Open this wireframe of single film card</summary>

![single-film-display](single-film-display.png "A single film card")

</details>
