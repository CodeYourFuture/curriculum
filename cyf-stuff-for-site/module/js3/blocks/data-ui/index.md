When we build user interfaces we often take data and {{<tooltip title="render">}}**rendering** is the process of building an interface from some code{{</tooltip>}} it in the user interface. We will model some real-life objects using data structures such as arrays and objects. However, end users don't directly interact with data structures. Instead, they'll interact with a rendering of these data structures through some user interface, typically a web browser. We're going to start with some structured data and explore how we can render it on the page.
