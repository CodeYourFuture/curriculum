This week you're building small UI components/apps using DOM manipulation. The aim of this session is to get together in groups and discuss strategy and implementation for the week's backlog issues.

## ðŸ§° Setup

1. You'll need to get into groups of no more than three

2. Choose one of the "Build a ..." issues e.g. "Build a slideshow app" from your [JS2 Week 3 backlog](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js2/sprints/3/backlog/). It can be an app that one of you have already started or one that you'd all like to tackle together during this session.

3. Have one person in your group share their screen.

4. As a group, you'll have to discuss your strategy and implementation for your chosen issue. Remember to use the acceptance criteria to check your progress.
