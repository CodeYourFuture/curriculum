### Job Boards

There are many job boards advertising tech jobs online. Becoming efficient at searching for opportunities online will save you time as you work on your applications.Â 

Job boards come in various formats the main two being:

- **General Job Boards** e.g. Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster, and Glass Door. These advertise across industries and are often good for junior-level positions.
- **Niche Jobs/Industry specificboards** e.g. Otta, GitHub, [devitjobs.uk.](devitjobs.uk.) These sites focus on specific skills or interests and can sometimes advertise roles not found on larger sites

Finding the right boards can make your job search easier. This involves identifying which sites advertise jobs that you are interested in, here is a link to sites highlighted by grads as useful for their searches: [[LIVE] Collective Job Research Form (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q62uWPJJ2HGc_f6RzFY5MRzfbSP17jHlhxImMlrfo2k/edit?resourcekey=&gid=841715262#gid=841715262)

## Search TermsÂ 

Use Search Terms to focus your search and make the best use of your time. You should

**Exercise:**Â

## Filters

Use filters to save you time and focus on the roles that youâ€™re aiming for, you can usually filter based on the following:Â 

- Locations
- Remote/Hybrid/In Person
- Type of contract (Full-time, Part-time, Permanent, Contract)
- Job Title/Role
- Experience

**Exercise:**Â 

- Pick a job board and a role title
- Search for the role using different variations of filters.Â 

Note: what changes do you see?Â 

- Do some search terms reveal jobs that youâ€™re more interested in?Â

## Alerts

Alerts allow you to save your search terms and get notifications when new jobs appear on a site that matches your criteria. This saves you time in your searches and allows you to apply quickly to new roles.Â 

Each site has different ways of setting up alerts (see LinkedInâ€™s [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a511279)) but they normally link to your profile or email.Â 

**Exercise:**

- Using the filters and search terms you found in the previous exercises set up alerts on different job sites.
- review these alerts as they update you over the next few weeks.
  - Are they finding good job openings?
  - How can you refine your search terms and filters to be more useful?

## Creating a profile

Some job boards allow you to create a profile. This can help match you to job opportunities and make sure that the jobs being advertised to you are a close match.Â 

It is worth setting up profiles that reflect your skills and experiences on your most used job sites.Â 

Hint: Remember to keep these profiles up to date as you work on projects, gain expertise and learn new skills. Keep a spreadsheet or document in which you know which websites you have signed up for and update them all when something changes.
