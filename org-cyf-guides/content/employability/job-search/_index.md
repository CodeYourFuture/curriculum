## Collectively finding job opportunities 
Finding the right roles to apply for can be time-consuming, and confirming their suitability can be confusing. Work together to cut down the time you spend searching for roles and spend more time focusing on making good applications. 

## Learning objectives

- [ ] Search for jobs using different online platforms.
- [ ] Locate the Collective Job Research form.
- [ ] Identify key company information in a job advert. 
- [ ] Add 1 job role to the Collective Job Research form.
- [ ] Check the suitability of the found job roles.

## Set-Up
- [ ] Split up into groups of no more than 5
- [ ] Set a whole class timer for 30 minutes

- [ ] Each team should select no more than 3 different platforms based on the list on the first tab of the Collective Job Research form.
