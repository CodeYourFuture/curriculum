# Job Searching

In this guide, we will review how to search for jobs in tech effectively. 

To make the most of this guide you should already have a clear understanding of the job(s) you want to apply for and the skills you excel at and want to use in your job. See [how to choose a job role] #TODO add link once other PR is merged. if you aren't sure yet. 

## Where to find jobs?

There are several places you can find job opportunities:

1. [Job Boards](#job-boards)
2. [Networking](#networking)
3. [Code Your Future](#code-your-future)

### Job Boards

There are many job boards advertising tech jobs online. Becoming efficient at searching for opportunities online will save you time as you work on your applications. Sometimes you are able to apply directly through the job board and sometimes they link you to the companies website. They may also have a messaging function so you are able to speak to the recruitment team through the job board directly.

Job boards come in various formats the main two being:

#### General Job Boards

These advertise across industries and are often good for junior-level positions. For example [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Job/index.htm), [Indeed](https://uk.indeed.com) and [Monster](https://www.monster.co.uk).

#### Industry Specific Boards

These sites focus on specific skills or interests and can often advertise tech roles not found on larger sites. For example [Otta/WelcomeToTheJungle](https://app.welcometothejungle.com), [Dev It Jobs](https://devitjobs.uk) and [Cord](https://cord.com).

Finding the right boards for you can make your job search easier, however there are a lot out there. Our recommendation is to spend some time identifying which sites advertise jobs that are closest to what you are interested in and then focusing on those sites.

### Networking

For general networking advice please see [our networking guide](./networking). When you are searching for a job a good first port of call is asking your existing network whether anyone they know is hiring. This can be messaging people individually or posting a public message on LinkedIn. You can also set your LinkedIn status to [looking for work](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507508/let-recruiters-know-you-re-open-to-work?lang=en) which helps people know you are job searching.

There are also tech meetups and gatherings where companies that are hiring often mention their open roles. The [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com) website is a good place to find tech meetups for learning, socialising and finding jobs.

### Code Your Future

The Code Your Future community is full of tech professionals keen to help. Connect with our community through Slack and LinkedIn. If you find connections through CYF who are related to a job opening then reach out! Here is a [guide](https://codeyourfuture.slack.com/docs/T2H71EFLK/F06V1DYV9ME) to how you can help Code Your Future create more hiring partnerships.

There is also a weekly meeting to collectively search for jobs, please see the [CodeYourFuture Global Calendar ](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/module/how-our-curriculum-works/#calendar)for timings and joining details. You can check the slack channels #cyf-employment and #cyf-job-opportunities for tips and a current spreadsheet of known opportunities.

## Search Terms

Use Search Terms to focus your search and make the best use of your time. When searching you should try different combinations of job titles that you're interested in and key skills. Remember that different companies often use different terminology to describe the same role, so make sure you try searching for both software developer and software engineer, if that's the role you're looking for. You may find some terms perform better on some sites as they may have different search algorithms.

You should also bear in mind that some jobs will have the level explicitly in the title, i.e.junior or associate, and others may not have any level mentioned, but within the job specification itself say something like "hiring at all levels of experience".

## Filters

Use filters to save you time and focus on the roles that you’re aiming for, you can usually filter based on the following: 

- Locations
- Remote/Hybrid/In Person
- Type of contract (Full-time, Part-time, Permanent, Contract)
- Job Title/Role
- Experience
- Skills

If you are not seeing many matches for your criteria it can be helpful to remove the filters and see what comes up so you can see what is available on the market even if it may not be your first choice.

## Alerts

Alerts allow you to save your search terms and filters and get notifications when new jobs appear on a site that matches your criteria. This means you don't need to fill out your search criteria every time and allows you to apply quickly to new roles.

It is often also advantageous to be an early applicant to a role and having alerts set up helps you to know as soon as a role goes online.

Each site has different ways of setting up alerts for example see [LinkedIn’s](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a511279)) but they normally link to your profile or email.

You may want to experiment tweaking the alerts getting set up so your inbox doesn't get overwhelmed.

## Creating a profile

Some job boards allow you to create a profile, which is typically similar to your CV but just formatted in a way to suit that particular job board. This can help match you to job opportunities and make sure that the jobs being advertised to you are a close match. Often there are hiring managers using the platform to search through the profiles on the site, so it can be a more effective way of being found on the site than just uploading a CV document that may not be parsed well during the search.

Sometimes you can import from your CV but always double check whether it has imported things into the right sections as their import tools can be a bit flakey. You can use the advice in the [CV section](./cvs) to help you fill out your profile.

Hint: Remember to keep these profiles up to date as you work on projects, gain expertise and learn new skills. Keep a spreadsheet or document in which you know which websites you have signed up for and update them all when something changes.
