The [Coding Interview Prep section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/) of FreeCodeCamp contains hundreds of coding challenges that test your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics. It also has several take-home projects you can use to develop your portfolio.

Do **not** work through everything on this page. Make a learning plan and choose things strategically, according to the roles you are preparing for. Learning to plan your work and use your time efficiently is a key skill for a developer.
