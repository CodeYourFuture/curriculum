## Mock interviews

Mock interviews are practice sessions set up to mimic a real interview. You prepare yourself with your body language and mental attitude to practice answering behavioural and technical questions.

You will use the techniques you learned during the course about using the STAR method and turning your Brag Diary entries into answers for the behavioural "tell me about a time...' questions.

## Technical interviews

The technical part of the interview will check your basic Javascript knowledge(or other languages you will work in). You will answer some theory questions as well as do some live coding to demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts.

You can use Evidenced to interview your peers and record the interviews to rewatch. This will help you understand what you are doing well and what you could do better in interview.
