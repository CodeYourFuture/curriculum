Before writing your CV and searching a job the first question you need to ask yourself is what job role do you want?

Within engineering there are multiple different job roles and there are also many roles that aren't engineering but still in tech that may be a good fit if you like creating tech products but don't want a coding heavy role.

Below is a summary of different roles that you may want to look at with a brief description of each. It is important to know that these are not the only roles, and each role may differ at each company so it's important to read the job description thoroughly and ask during the interview process any questions you may have as to how the role works in practice.

During your job search you can also search by skill and technology rather than by job title to see what matches come up, so even if you read through these roles and haven't decided exactly which one you want, don't worry, you can start searching for jobs by skill and come back and use this as a reference at any point.

In 2025 we had CYF graduates hired into the following roles: Software Engineer, Software Developer, Assistant Software Engineer, Systems Support, Business Analyst, Python Developer, Junior Web Developer, Junior Solution Engineer, Junior Software Engineer, IT Support Technician, Cloud Platform Engineer, Cloud Open Source Engineer, Associate Software Engineer.

As you can see it is quite a broad mix which shows just how many different avenues Code Your Future can open up for you.
