If you are unsure what sort of job would be right for you, it can be helpful to look at a skills framework to see where your strengths and weakness lie and what sort of skills are needed for each job. When you are doing your job search you can also search by skill instead of by job title to see what jobs match those skills. During your career you will likely also have appraisal periods where you have to self evaluate your skills and have others give you feedback on them, so having a good self awareness of your skills will stand you in good stead for your whole career as well as your first tech job search.

There are 2 commonly used ones. These have not been used very extensively within Code Your Future yet so give them a try and share your feedback as to whether they were useful and which is your favourite.
