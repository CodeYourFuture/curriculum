A complete LinkedIn profile (scoring 100%) is 40 times more likely to receive opportunities through LinkedIn. This is because a completed profile ranks higher in the internal algorithm, meaning you‚Äôre more likely to be discovered.

Here‚Äôs what you need on your profile to get there:

- ### Profile picture
- ### Location and industry
- ### Experience (a current position, with a brief description, plus two previous positions)
- ### Skills (at least three)
- ### Education
- ### At least 50 connections
