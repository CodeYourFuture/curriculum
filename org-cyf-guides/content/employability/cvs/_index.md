The purpose of a CV is to give an employer a brief written summary of your experience and skills to convince them you would be a great hire.

It should have enough detail to get you to the interview stage and to be a starting point they can then ask you further questions on.

A recruiter will typically skim through your CV for 5-10 seconds before making an initial decision on whether to reject your application or if you are someone worth pursuing further. Therefore it is important that you stand out and that is it easy to read and find key information. 

Typically after your CV has been approved by a recruiter, it may then be reviewed by a hiring manager, senior level engineers, product managers or equivalent and possible senior management or managers from different domains who may be involved in the interview process. If you are applying for a technical role it is important your CV is accessible enough to be understood by someone who is not an engineer, but has enough specific information for a senior engineer to have a high level understanding of your technical capabilities.

It is likely you will want to create different versions of your CV highlighting different aspects that may be more relevant for different jobs. It should be a living document that you frequently refine as you get more experience.
