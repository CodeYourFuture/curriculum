## CV layout

The layout of the CV should be right for the role you're applying for. An accountant's CV can be boring, and a creative's CV can be more visually appealing. For most CVs, including your CV for tech jobs, the content is king. Layout and eye-appeal is secondary and in many cases can detract from the content. This is why a simple "black text on a white background" format goes a long way.

Your CV should be a single column. Avoid 2-column layouts as they are more difficult to read.

Applicant Tracking Systems often mess up column formatting, making your CV unreadable.
