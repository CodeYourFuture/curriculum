## CV layout

The layout of the CV should be right for the role you're applying for. An accountant's CV can be boring, and a creative's CV can be more visually appealing. For your CV, the content is king. Layout and eye-appeal is secondary and in many cases can detract from the content. 

Your CV should be a single column. Avoid 2-column layouts. 

Applicant Tracking Systems often mess up column formatting, making your CV unreadable.
