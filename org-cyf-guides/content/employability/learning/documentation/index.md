If you have not taken the [Technical Writing course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one), do so now.

There are three key aspects of technical writing for developers:

### Code

Your code should be simple, clearly named, and easy to follow. Your code must express your ideas, not encrypt them.

### Comments

Why, not what

Your comments should explain why you've made a choice, not what the code does. Your code should be simple, clearly named, and easy to follow, and if it isn't, refactor it.

### Documentation

Your clearly named code and comments are a love letter to your colleagues and, indeed, your future self. Treat your future self like a dear friend you want to work with on your project. What do they need to know? What problems did you encounter during development and how did you solve them?
