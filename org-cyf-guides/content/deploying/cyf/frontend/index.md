## Creating a frontend

**Click "Add New Resource"**

**Add the GitHub repository**

The hosting platform needs to know how where to get your backend from.

You probably want to add a "Public Repository" Git Based repository, to tell it your project is in GitHub.

If you want your application to auto-deploy when you push changes to it, you'll need to instead choose "Private Repository (with GitHub App)" and set up a GitHub App yourself.

Open your GitHub in another tab, and **copy the HTTPS Clone URL**

Go back to the CYF Hosting and **paste the URL into the "Repository URL" field**

**Click "Check repository"**.

Click **It is a static site?**.

Press **Continue**.

## Configuring the frontend

Most things should Just Work.

There are some things you may want or need to configure. If you do change any, you need to press the **Enter** key to save the change.

If your frontend is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you should set the **Base Directory**.

You may want to choose a friendly/memorable **Domain**:

If you want to deploy from a branch that isn't `main`, you need to configure this in the Git Source tab:

## Deploying the frontend

When everything is configured correctly, press the **Deploy** button:

Watch the logs. Fix anything that goes wrong. When the deploy is finished, you can test out your frontend.

## Fix MIME types

If your frontend uses `.mjs` files, you need to customise the Nginx configuration so that these are served with the correct MIME type.

Do this by:

Pressing **Generate Default Nginx Configuration**

![Generate Default Nginx Configuration](generate-default-nginx-configuration.png)

Paste this text before the final `}` in the generated config:

```
    # Serve .mjs files with the correct MIME type
    include mime.types;
    types {
        application/javascript js mjs;
    }
```

![Paste MIME type config](paste-mime-type-config.png)

Save the configuration, and deploy again.

We hope to make this step unnecessary in the future.
