Some tips we've accumulated through experience:

* **Webcams**: Encourage everyone to turn on their webcams, it's more engaging.
* **Roles**: Have people add "Trainee" or "Volunteer" to the end of their name, to easily identify people and also put people into breakout rooms.
* **Popcorning**: If you're trying to have everyone talk about something, have everyone raise their hands, and lower their hand after they've spoken. Then you can tell who hasn't spoken yet.
* **Cold calling**: Say a name of someone to answer a question, don't just say "Who wants to answer".
* **Breakout rooms**: Set up breakout rooms intentionally - make sure you have at least one volunteer in each room, and mix up who is working with whom.


### Zoom-specific

* **Hosts**: Make sure you know how to claim host. Hosts can manage breakout rooms much better than co-hosts or non-hosts.

### Virtual Meeting Etiquette
* **Mic**: Mics are stay muted by default, unless it is their turn to speak. Request everyone to mute after they have finished speaking.
