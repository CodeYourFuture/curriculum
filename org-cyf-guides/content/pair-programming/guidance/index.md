## How

You can do pair programming in person (sharing one computer), or remotely (either by sharing your screen, or using something like [CodeTogether](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=genuitecllc.codetogether)).

## Guidance for learners

When approaching a problem, you need to **explain your thought process**, **plan out what to do**, **write the code**, and **check that it works**.

## Guidance for mentors

**Help people learn**: Most of the exercises the trainees are doing aren't useful in their own right. The point is for the trainee to learn and grow through them. Focus on understanding, and techniques that will help solve the next problem.

**Don't take over!** It's important trainees get used to figuring things out. Provide guidance and assistance but trainees need to struggle to overcome any obstacles with understanding and technical communication. It can be uncomfortable to watch someone struggle, but make sure they've considered and tried all of their ideas before you intervene.

**Give honest feedback**: Trainees can't develop if they don't receive honest feedback about their progress.

**Ask questions**: Asking a clarifying question can help learners discover errors and often promotes more thoughtful responses. **Asking is better than telling**.

**Encourage re-usable techniques**: Reinforce techniques like reading error messages carefully, looking up documentation, and thinking about edge cases.
