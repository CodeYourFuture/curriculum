Pair programming is working together with someone else to code a solution to a problem.

## Why
Pair programming is an excellent way to develop programming and communication skills.

It can be easier to work through a problem when working with someone 1-to-1.

Pair programming prepares our trainees for technical interviews when they'll code in front of other people.

## How

Choose your style: [mentored](./mentored/) or [driver/navigator](./driver-navigator/). Think about whether to pair with another learner or a mentor - both are useful, but they're different.

Pick a piece of programming to do, find a buddy, and work on it together.
