Pair programming is an excellent way to develop programming and communication skills.

It can be easier to work through a problem when working with someone 1-to-1.

It also helps our trainees to prepare for technical interviews when they'll need to code in front of other people.

## What

Pair programming is working together with someone else to code a solution to a problem.

Pick a piece of programming to do, find a buddy, and work on it together.

Sometimes one person does all of the writing, and has discussion with the other. Other times, people take turns writing.
