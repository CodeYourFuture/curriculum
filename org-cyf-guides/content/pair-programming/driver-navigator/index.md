A common form of pair-programming has the pairs taking turns. One acts as the "driver" - actually using the keyboard. The other acts as the "navigator" - providing directions and support.

This is different from [mentored pair programming](../mentored/) where the learner is doing most of the work, with the mentor is there to support and stretch.

You can do driver/navigator pair programming regardless of the levels of the pairs. Two learners can do this. A learner can do this with a mentor. Both are useful. Lots of people do this at work as software engineers: this is not just for learning.

If a learner is pairing with a mentor, they should still take turns. The learner will benefit from writing code. The learner will also benefit from seeing how the mentor writes code. Mentors will be able to help both by seeing how a learner writes code, and how they think/direct.
