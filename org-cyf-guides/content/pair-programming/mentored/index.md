We assign **mentored pair programming** as a coursework assignment throughout the course.

This is different from [driver/navigator](../driver-navigator/) pair-programming where the pairs take turns.

All of the standard [pair programming guidance](../guidance) applies - make sure you're familiar with it.

**Before** a mentored pair programming session, learners should decide what they're going to pair on and share this with the volunteer, e.g. by sharing a link to a particular Codewars exercise, a particular piece of coursework, or some other problem.

**During** mentored pair programming, the **learner** should:
* **Explain** their thought process
* **Break down** the problem
* **Plan** what code to write
* **Write** all of the code
* **Check** that it works

The **mentor** should:
* **Ask questions** to get the trainee thinking. It's always better to _ask_ than tell.
* Help the trainee think about breaking down the problem
* Support the trainee as they write code
* Help the trainee to debug their code
* Stretch the trainee by bringing up edge cases or complications

This is different from other forms of pair programming (e.g. [driver/navigator](../driver-navigator/)), where both people may be expected to write code, or people may take turns at different roles. This is because the goal is different: the goal is **teaching**.
