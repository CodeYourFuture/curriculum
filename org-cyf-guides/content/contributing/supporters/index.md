## 🪙 Supporting us with grants and donations

Code Your Future is a crazy dream, started in a basement by volunteers. Since 2016, it has grown into an international voluntary organisation funded by donations, grants, and hiring/recruitment fees. We can not do this without you. We are so grateful for your support.

Our particular thanks to [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/news/inside-stories/our-partnership-with-codeyourfuture/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/slack-cyf-plus-engineering-employment-pathways-refugees), our major donors and stalwart friends.

> From one to another: all [donations from individuals](https://codeyourfuture.io/donate/) go directly to pay individual trainee expenses: laptops, internet, bus tickets, childcare, and food.

## 🏠 Supporting our classes with free venues

We do not own premises. Thank you to our venue sponsors for providing free venues for our Saturday workshops, jobfairs, and midweek coworking and study groups. If you can help us with a venue, please [get in touch](mailto:contact@codeyourfuture.io?subject=We%20can%20host%20classes%20for%20free).
