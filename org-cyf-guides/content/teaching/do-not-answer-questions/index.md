Instead, help a trainee answer their own question.

If someone asks "How can I make this text green", instead of telling them, consider answering:
* What could we Google to find that out?
* When have you done something similar?

If someone asks "Why is this text green?":
1. <a href="{{<relref "../getting-help/asking-questions">}}">Make them ask a better question</a>
2. Ask "What techniques do we have to work this out?" (have _them_ identify that devtools could be useful).

Helping someone craft a good search will help them much more in the future than giving them the answer.
