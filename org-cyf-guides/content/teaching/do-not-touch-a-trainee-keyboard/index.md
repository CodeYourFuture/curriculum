People learn by doing.

Even if it's going to be slower, or frustrating, _explain_ to a trainee what you need them to type/do, and have them do it.

Don't do it for them.

This helps trainees to practice.

Also, often times an expert will do some things without realising they're doing them. If you have to explain them, you can't skip them!
