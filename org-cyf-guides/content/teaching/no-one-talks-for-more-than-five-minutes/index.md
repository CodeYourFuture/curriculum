Talking for long periods of time means you're not getting feedback on what is/isn't being understood.

It also often leads to people disengaging, and stopping taking in new information.

Whether you're a volunteer or a trainee, if you've been talking for 5 minutes, stop and find out what the people you're talking with are thinking.
