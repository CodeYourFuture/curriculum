In CodeYourFuture's courses, we use PRs a little differently.
For coursework, merging is not required. Instead of relying on "approve and merge,"
we use labels to show the state of a PR.

Here is a summary of labels to be added to a PR:

- `Needs review`
  - Added by a **trainee** when a PR is first created, or when all reviewer feedback has been 
    addressed
  - Replaces `Reviewed` (if present)

- `Review in progress`
  - Added by a **mentor** to show that they are currently reviewing the PR

- `Reviewed`
  - Added by a **mentor** once the PR has been reviewed and the trainee can start working 
    on feedback - this indicates there is something more for the trainee to do.
  - Replaces `Needs review` and `Review in progress`

- `Complete`
  - Added by a **mentor** when the PR has been approved and no more work is required on this PR
