### Keeping a branch clean

A **clean branch** contains only the work you want to share, nothing more.
It makes your PR easier to review.

To keep your exercise branch clean:

1. **Create your branch from `main`**.

2. **Keep `main` clean and updated**.
    - _Clean_ -> no changes should be committed to `main`.
    - _Updated_ -> regularly use
     [Sync Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
     to keep your repo up-to-date with the upstream repository.

3. **Make only related changes**.
    - Add or modify only the files in the folder belonging to the exercise.

### Keeping code clean

Clean code makes it easier for you, your teammates, and your reviewers to understand and
work with.

Refer to the [Code Style Guide](https://programming.codeyourfuture.io/guides/reviewing/style-guide/)
to learn how to keep your code professional.

### Get a second opinion from AI tools

Before submitting a PR, you can use AI tools to review your code, documentation, or explanations.

AI can help you:
- Spot typos, formatting issues, or unclear comments.
- Suggest possible improvements to your code or approach.
- Highlight missing edge cases or potential problems.

Think of AI as a second pair of eyes -- helpful for polishing your work.  
And don’t worry: using AI is **not cheating**. You can accept AI suggestions, but only if you understand them well enough to explain the change. Once you can do that, the learning truly becomes yours.
