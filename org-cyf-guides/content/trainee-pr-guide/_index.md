### What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **pull request**, or **PR**, is a way to share your code for review.
In professional projects, PRs are used to suggest changes and then merge them into the main project.

At {{<our-name>}}, we use PRs mainly as a way for you to submit your work for review and feedback.
Think of it like handing in an assignment - the PR is the place where you "submit" your code so 
mentors and teammates can:
- ✅ See what you changed (new code, fixes, or features)
- 💬 Discuss the changes (comments, suggestions, or questions)
- 👍 Review and provide feedback (approve or request improvements)

For most coursework, merging will not happen. You will update your code based on feedback, learn 
from the process, and keep practicing.

### How do you work with a PR? 

To get the most out of a PR, follow these steps to get 
clear feedback, show your progress, and learn more effectively.
