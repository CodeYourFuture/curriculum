Responding to PR feedback is like a conversation: **listen**, **reply thoughtfully**, and 
**show that you acted on feedback**.

1. **Be respectful and collaborative**
    - Treat comments as opportunities to learn, not criticism.
    - Even if you disagree, respond politely and explain your reasoning.

2. **Acknowledge feedback**
    - If you agree -> say _"Good point, I'll fix it."_
    - If you don't fully agree -> say _"I see your point. Here's why I approached it this way ..."_
    - **Don't ignore comments** -- silence can feel dismissive.

3. **Make changes, then confirm**
    - After addressing a comment, let the reviewer know (e.g., _"I've updated the variable name 
      as suggested."_).
    - This shows you're actively engaging in the review.

4. **Ask questions if unclear**
    - If you don't understand a suggestion, ask for clarification.
    - Example: _"Could you explain what you mean by simplifying this function?"_

**Markdown** is a language for formatting plain text.
You can use Markdown syntax, along with some additional HTML tags, to format your writing on GitHub, 
in places like repository READMEs and comments on pull requests and issues.
