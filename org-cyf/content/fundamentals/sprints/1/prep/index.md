## Professional Accounts (2 hours)

Download and install the following software or register for the apps.

Click on the links to go to the registration pages. Keep your login details for all sites/apps consistent and always use your real name.

{{<note type="info" title="Real Name" >}}
CYF recognises you may need to keep your birth name private. When we say real name, we mean the name you go by. It does not have to match your birth certificate or any other legal document. It has to be consistent and professional.

### Gmail, Google Account

Make a new Google account if you do not have a professional one already. Use your real name. Don‚Äôt use any numbers or words that are not your name. Never put the year of your birth in your professional email address. Your email address should look something like this:

> JDoe@gmail.com
> JohnDoe@gmail.com
> JaneDoe@gmail.com

This is your public professional email address. Use it to sign up for all your professional accounts unless you can use your GitHub.

- [ ] I have made a professional Google account and Gmail address.

### Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the first browser we will all use together.

- [ ] I have downloaded and installed Google Chrome.

<!-- CYF-ONLY -->
Use your professional Chrome profile for all your CYF work. You will often have to share your screen during class, so keep your personal internet use private and away from your professional profile.<!-- END-CYF-ONLY -->

### LinkedIn

Your cohort is your first network, and this is one of the most valuable things you can develop at Code Your Future. A strong, tightly linked, professional network is a powerful asset, so begin building it today.<!-- END-CYF-ONLY -->

CYF understands you may need to keep your picture off the internet. In this case, generate [a robohash picture](https://robohash.org/) from your name, and use that for all these accounts. Use your robohash consistently and it will help us recognise each other.

In ITD, you wrote code in Codepen - an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This was really useful, we can save code there and see what it does.

Download and install VSCode - you will be using it in this course.
