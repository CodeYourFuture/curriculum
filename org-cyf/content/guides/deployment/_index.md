# What is deployment?

Deploying in short is making sure the application you are developing is made available for the world wide web to see (or in case for internal systems it is at least visible to the intended audience). Without the ability to deploy the only way to show what you have done is ask others to come to your computer, and show them the work on it in person.

{{<note type="note" title="TL;DR">}}
The CYF Curriculum team suggest [Netlify]({{< ref "/guides/deployment/deployment-netlify" >}}). as a free provider to use for both your frontend and backend applications, with Supabase as a free database layer for persistence. This is because among the free tier offerings they have the least amount of limitations.

This suggestion assumes that you are interested in a fully free option, and you can accept the limitations. If you have a deployment budget for your work and/or the limitations are not acceptable you are free to look at other choices as well.
