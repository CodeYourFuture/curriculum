A personal website allows you to showcase your projects and skills in a personal and attractive way. It is also a fun project that keeps you practicing your skills and demonstrating your creativity.

When making a personal website approach it like a final project - make a plan and then do sprints to deliver updates. Remember - you can continue to add features and iterate once it's live so it will continue to improve as you do!

- **Don't** use stock websites or templates - this is a demonstration of your skills, not someone else's!
- **Remember** that you should be demonstrating the skills you'll be using in your job. Focus on adding the most in-demand features and stacks first.
