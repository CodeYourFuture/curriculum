Your GitHub portfolio should be a curated mix of projects you completed as part of CYF and some passion projects. It should show that you care about your work, that you are interested in coding and that you are a self-motivated person with good communication skills.

Choose 2 to 6 of your best projects and pin them to your Github profile.

Make sure your pinned projects demonstrate your best work

Keep updating your projects as you build new ones

Project Readme Criteria
Do the readmes on your portfolio projects say things like "A starting point for CYF's TV show DOM project" and nothing else? How does this look to an employer? (It looks bad.)

How to Write a Good README File for Your GitHub Project
freeCodeCamp.org
Here are some guide questions that will help you out:

### What was your motivation?

### Why did you build this project?

### What problem does it solve?

### What did you learn?

What makes your project stand out?
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.
