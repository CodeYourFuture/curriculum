## üîÉ Comparing changes

As developers, we often develop new features on a branch.

When we've completed the feature, we need to **merge** our changes into another branch.

So we'll need a way to compare changes between two different branches on GitHub.

Let's consider the following situation.

We have a repository like this:

### Original repository

```mermaid
---
title: CodeYourFuture/GitHomeworkTest
---
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   commit
   commit
```

And there's another forked repository belonging to owner **Dedekind561**.
Dedekind561 has created a branch called `bio-page` with the new feature.

### üç¥ Forked repository

```mermaid
---
title: Dedekind561/GitHomeworkTest
---
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   commit
   commit
   branch bio-page
   commit
   commit
   commit
```

> üéØ Goal: Merge changes from the `bio-page` branch into the CodeYourFuture/GitHomeworkTest `main` branch

## Pull Request

To merge changes from one branch to another, we need to let other users know:

- what the changes are
- which branches we're comparing
- additional context about the proposed change, like why we're making the change

For this purpose, we can use a **pull request**.

{{<note type="definition" title="definition: Pull Request">}}

A **pull request** is a request to merge code from one branch into another.

## Creating a new pull request

During the course, we'll use pull requests to review your work. You'll need to push your work on a branch and then open a pull request to get feedback on your work.

We can use the Github interface to create a new pull request.

The steps below assume you have a forked a repository called `GitHomeworkTest` and you've pushed a branch to this remote repository.

### Step 1

Go to your forked repository. The page should look like this:

![github-fork-main-page](github-fork-main-page.png)

Double check your url, it should be `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GitHomeworkTest`

### Step 2

Locate the branches button on this page.

![github-fork-highlight-branches](github-fork-highlight-branches.png)

### Step 3

üìù Double check you're on a branches view like this.

![github-branches-view](github-branches-view.png)

### Step 4

Locate the **New pull request** button for the `bio-page` branch.

![highlight-new-pull-request](highlight-new-pull-request.png)

### Step 5

Double check you can see the **Open a pull request** view.

![open-pull-request-page](open-pull-request-page.png)

#### Questions

a) Double check the base repository ( it should be set to `CodeYourFuture/GitHomeworkTest` )
b) Double check the head repository ( this should be the forked repository `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/GitHomeworkTest` )
c) Double check the base branch ( this should be set to `main` )
d) Double check the head branch ( this should be set to `bio-page` )

### Step 6

Update the pull request title to include your **region**, **name** and the **week** the coursework is for.

### Step 7

Update the pull request description with information about the changes on your branch.

Below we've added a description "Create a bio page with details about myself"

![update-pr-title](update-pr-title-description.png)

### Step 8

Finally, click on **Create pull request**.

Double check you end up with a pull request like this:

![new-pr-landing-page](new-pr-landing-page.png)

#### Questions

a) Locate the **Files changed** tab and check the change you've added in your branch
b) Locate the **Commits** tab and check the commits from your `bio-page` branch

## Using a pull request template

Some repositories are set up with a **template** for a description, which gets automatically set in the **Open a pull request** view.

Check the description field for any instructions to complete the pull request.

Check out the example below:

Here there are some prompts for you to fill in information - make sure you fill it in.
