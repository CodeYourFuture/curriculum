Code Your Future helps people who need it most to reach their goal of working in tech. Our innovative programme supports people all the way into secure employment as a software engineer.

**Our trainees are people living in poverty**, disabled people, long term unemployed, refugees, asylum seekers, ex-offenders, single parents, and anyone else facing material barriers to digital education and employment in tech.

**Our graduates work in great companies** including Capgemini, Deloitte, JP Morgan, Financial Times, AWS, Thoughtworks, the BBC, AND Digital and many more.

**All our classes are free and our teachers are volunteers.** Our volunteers are professionals working in the local tech sector and they lead our course delivery.

**We build communities and networks of inclusion everywhere we go**, bringing different worlds together, and integrating people into their local communities, teachers and learners both. We come together for a live session at the weekend, and trainees work through coursework and projects 20 hours a week, independently around their commitments, including day jobs.

**CYF was founded by migrants for refugees**, and now welcomes everyone facing material barriers to technical education. Starting with a class of 6 people in 2016, and growing every day, we have helped over 240 people start their career in tech.

## Our Approach

We do our work in public; our courses are free and open source and we develop them in public as FOSS projects on GitHub. Right here!
