# Code Your Future Curriculum

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/34db2751-bd7a-4828-a54d-787fa17b11e9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cyf-curriculum/deploys)

https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/

## Tools

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static site generator
- [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) - Asset pipeline
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting and deployment
- [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Signposts) - Source code repository
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - Bash script to create new module structures

## Developing the source website

### To install

```bash
brew install go hugo
```

### To run locally

#### Generate a token

You'll need to get a fine-grained GitHub API token which allows read-only access to all public CYF repos from [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).

Click "Generate new token", enter a token name (can be anything), and how long you want the token to last (if you're doing a one-off contribution, pick a short value; if you're going to be a regular contributor, maybe a longer value).

Make sure the Resource owner is _your_ account if you have a choice.

The "Repository access" you need is "Public repositories (read-only)", and you don't need any account permissions:

</details>

#### Set up `.env`

Copy the `.env.example` file over to the root of /curriculum and rename it `.env`. Edit the file and then change the line that says `HUGO_CURRICULUM_GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN` to contain the token that you have generated earlier.

#### Run this command

Run this command in a terminal, substituting in the github API token you generated above:

```bash
npm i
npm run start:dev
```

If you find the build is very slow, and don't care about the issues being pulled into backlogs being precise, you can run:

```bash
npm run start:dev -- --environment issues-are-cached-and-incomplete
```

### To create a new module

```bash
./create_module <module-name>
```

### Linting

All CYF repos use the Prettier standard. However, Prettier doesn't have golang by default so you must install a plugin for it to work in VSCode. I've included it in the package.json.

### Site Search

PageFind runs the search. https://pagefind.app/
It's in the build command on Netlify `hugo && npx pagefind --source "public"`
If you need to develop on this locally, run:

```zsh
rm -rf public &&
hugo && npx pagefind --site "public" --serve
```

And go to http://localhost:1414/ to see the PageFind-served site with search enabled; but there is no hot reload. You can run hugo on http://localhost:1313/ at the same time.

Code Your Future helps people who need it most to reach their goal of working in tech. Our innovative programme supports people all the way into secure employment as a software engineer.

**Our trainees are people living in poverty**, disabled people, long term unemployed, refugees, asylum seekers, ex-offenders, single parents, and anyone else facing material barriers to digital education and employment in tech.

**Our graduates work in great companies** including Capgemini, Deloitte, JP Morgan, Financial Times, AWS, Thoughtworks, the BBC, AND Digital and many more.

**All our classes are free and our teachers are volunteers.** Our volunteers are professionals working in the local tech sector and they lead our course delivery.

**We build communities and networks of inclusion everywhere we go**, bringing different worlds together, and integrating people into their local communities, teachers and learners both. We come together for a live session at the weekend, and trainees work through coursework and projects 20 hours a week, independently around their commitments, including day jobs.

**CYF was founded by migrants for refugees**, and now welcomes everyone facing material barriers to technical education. Starting with a class of 6 people in 2016, and growing every day, we have helped over 240 people start their career in tech.

## Our Approach

We do our work in public; our courses are free and open source and we develop them in public as FOSS projects on GitHub. Right here!

## Documentation
