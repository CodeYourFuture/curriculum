This view compiles learning objectives from the day plan and prep view into a checkbox list to help trainees check in on their progress.

Before you consider yourself to have completed a sprint, make sure you can do everything in the list. If you're not confident in any of them, consider re-doing prep, re-doing exercises, or talking to someone about it.
