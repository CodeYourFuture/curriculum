Render support frontend deployments either via their CDN, or by changing your backend code to support serving frontend files. If you wish CDN style deployment we suggest you use Netlify instead. For a guide on how to update your backend to support serving frontend files please read [the Fly.io frontend guide](../flyio/serving-frontend) guide.
