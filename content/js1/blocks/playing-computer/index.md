To understand how `convertToPercentage` works we must build a mental model of how the computer executes our code. To make sense of how the computer executes our code, we use a method called {{<tooltip title="playing computer">}}**Playing computer** means simulating how the computer executes our code. We "step through" the code, line by line, and work out what the computer does when it follows each instruction.{{</tooltip>}}

We will use an interactive code visualiser to play computer.

{{<note type="activity" title="Playing computer">}}

In a JavaScript program, each line is an instruction to the computer that will produce some effect. For example, a line of code with a variable declaration means "store a new variable with this value". In the interactive widget, arrows are used to show which line just executed and which line is next to be executed.

Click _next_ to see what happens when the computer executes the following program. Pay particular attention to what happens when the function `convertToPercentage` is called.

### 🖼️ Global frame

As we step through the program, we keep track of two things: _memory_ and the _line that is being currently executed_. We keep track of this information using a {{<tooltip title="frame">}} Think of a frame as the context in which some code gets executed. We use frames to keep track of memory and the line of code that is being currently executed.{{</tooltip>}}

The _global frame_ is always the first frame that gets created when our program starts executing. The global frame is like the starting point for our program, the place where code gets executed first. When we run the code above, `decimalNumber` and `convertToPercentage` are both stored in the _global frame_.

### 🖼️  Local frame

{{<note type="tip" title="recall">}}
A **function call** is an instruction to run the code inside a function
{{</note>}}

Whenever we call a function a new frame is created for executing the code inside that function. In the example above, we call the function `convertToPercentage` on line 7 and then a new frame is created for `convertToPercentage`. Inside the `convertToPercentage` frame, the computer executes the instructions inside `convertToPercentage`, storing new variables in memory and keeping track of the current line that is being executed.
