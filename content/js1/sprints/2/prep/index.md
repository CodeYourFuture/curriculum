## Notes

### üß© Percentages

Given a number I want to convert it into a percentage format.

For example, given the number `0.5` we should get `"50%"`
And given the number `0.23` we should get `"23%"` and so forth.

### Restating the problem

We want to implement some functionality to convert _any_ given number into a percentage.
Previously, we saw how to use some functions to perform a given task. Here are some examples:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
console.log("hello world"); // prints "hello world" to the console
Math.round(3.141); // will output 3
```

All these expressions are _function calls_: we‚Äôre passing input to the functions, `console.log` or `Math.round` to use their functionality. In the case of `Math.round` and `console.log` these functions have been created and made available to use whenever we start running a program with NodeJS. However, there is so no such pre-built function that allows us to convert any number to a percentage. So we're going to create a function called `convertToPercentage` with the following properties:

- takes any number input
- converts it to a string output in percentage form.

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
convertToPercentage(0.5); // should return "50%"
```

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
convertToPercentage(0.23); // should return "23%"
```

<br>

### Useful expressions

We want to convert _any_ number into a percentage string. It is often helpful to solve a problem in one specific instance before doing it in any case.

In programming, we always try the simplest thing first. Let‚Äôs consider how to convert just one number in to a percentage.
Let‚Äôs consider the variable declaration below:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
const num = 0.5;
```

We want to create an expression for the percentage using the value of `num`.
To convert to a percentage, we can multiply the number by 100 and then add a `"%"` sign on the end.

So we can write:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
const num = 0.5;
const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
```

Recalling template literals, the expression in the curly braces will be evaluated first and then inserted into the string, giving us the percentage string.

<br>

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Wrapping up functionality

Now we want to wrap up the expression we‚Äôve created and reuse it to convert any number into a percentage.

We can write a function declaration to reuse some code. A function declaration looks like this:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {}
```

The `function` declaration consists of the following syntactic elements:

- `function` keyword, denotes the beginning of a function declaration
- convertToPercentage` - this is the name of the function
- `{}` - the body of the function is written inside the curly braces

We can wrap the functionality we want to reuse inside the curly braces by writing:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
}
```

<br>

### üîé Checking the output

Now we can call our function and store the output in a variable.
We can write:

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["5"],linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
}
const result = convertToPercentage(0.3);
```

Then we can print the value of the result to the terminal using `console.log`.

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["6"],linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
}
const result = convertToPercentage(0.3);
console.log(result);
```

<br>

{{<note type="question" title="exercise">}}
Given the code above, try predicting what `result` will evaluate to.

{{</note>}}

### Undefined values

When we log result's value to the terminal we get a new data type - `undefined`.  
`undefined` is a data type used to represent the absence of some value.  
A function‚Äôs output is always `undefined` whenever we omit a return statement; but we need to get a percentage from our function every time it is called.

<br>

### Setting an output

In the body of our function, we can write a `return` statement, specifying the value we want to output.  
If your function call is like a question, the return statement is the answer. It's what comes back.
We can add a return statement to the function as follows:

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["4"],linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}
```

Now that our function contains a `return` statement we can re-run our script to check the output.

### Calling with different arguments

Now we have a function declaration we can check if our function works for any number. We can call `convertToPercentage` with different arguments and check the outputs we get each time.

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["7-8"],linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}

const output1 = convertToPercentage(0.5);
const output2 = convertToPercentage(0.3);
```

When we execute the code we _want_ to log the target output for each input `0.5` and `0.3`:

```bash
50%
23%
```

However, _given the function's current implementation_, we get the following logs:

```bash
50%
50%
```

### üíª Playing computer

To understand how our function currently behaves we must start building an understanding of how our code is executed. We might currently have some ideas of how code is executed in our program:

```mermaid
mindmap
Root[How is a piece of code executed?]
    B[Lines of code are executed from top to bottom]
    C[Variable declarations mean data is stored in memory]
    D[Function call means running the instructions inside the function]
    E[When returning from a function we get an output]
```

### ‚û°Ô∏è Current line of code

We can make use of execution diagrams to visualise how a program is executed by a computer.

Firstly, we need a way to track the **line of code that is currently executing.** In the diagrams below, we use an arrow to indicate which line of code is currently being executed. Each line is an instruction to the computer that will produce some effect. For example, a line of code with a variable declaration means "store a new variable with a particular value".

Let's consider an example:

<iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=const%20name%20%3D%20'Gayle'%3B&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

In the example above, we have a single variable declaration:

```js
const name = "Gayle";
```

which means store a string `"Gayle"` in memory.

### üóíÔ∏è Storing things in memory

As variables are declared, we need a way to keep track of the memory that is stored as our program executes.
In our diagrams, we keep track of memory using a _frame_.

For now, we can think of a frame as a space in our diagram that represents the variables stored in memory in some part of our code.

The _global frame_ is always the first frame that gets created when our program starts executing. We can think of the _global frame_ as a location for variables created outside of any function. When we run the variable declaration above, we get a string `"Gayle"` stored in the Global frame:

![global-frame](global-frame.png)

Every time you click on the next button in the diagram you should observe changes to the memory in the frame.

### üèÉ Executing functions

So far we've seen 2 things:

- lines of code are executed from top to bottom
- we keep track of variables stored in memory using a global frame

However, we need to consider what happens when we declare and call a function in our program.
Let's consider another example:

<iframe width="850" height="375" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=const%20firstName%20%3D%20'German'%3B%0Aconst%20lastName%20%3D%20'Bencii'%3B%0A%0Afunction%20makeGreeting%28%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20const%20greeting%20%3D%20%60Hello%20there%60%3B%20%0A%7D%0A%0AmakeGreeting%28%29%3B&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=5&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

The first thing in the program is the function declaration for `makeGreeting`.

`makeGreeting` is stored in the Global frame as an **object**. We don't need to explore objects as this point - all we need to understand at this stage is that objects are a data type in JavaScript. We will return to objects in more depth later on in the course.

On line 11 we have a function call:

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["7"],linenostart=1}
function makeGreeting() {
  const greeting = "Hello there!";
}
const firstName = "German";
const lastName = "Bencci";

makeGreeting();
```

A function call means "go execute the instructions in the body of a function".

ü§î In our diagram we need a way to show what happens to the current executing line when a function is called.

{{<note type="activity" title="exercise">}}
Given the code above, try using the visualisation diagrams to work out what happens when makeFreeting` is called on line 278.

What happens to the arrow indicating the current line of code that we're executing.
What else do you notice when `makeGreeting` is called above?

{{</note>}}

The arrow representing the current line of execution now moves to the first line inside the function: this shows that the computer now starts running instructions inside the function.

In addition, another frame is created when we call `makeGreeting`:

![make-greeting-frame](make-greeting-frame.png)

Like the global frame, the `makeGreeting` frame will be used to track variables that are created when `makeGreeting` is executed.

<br>

### üì• Returning from a function

Earlier we defined output for the function by writing a return statement and setting a return value.

<iframe width="800" height="350" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=function%20makeGreeting%28%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20const%20greeting%20%3D%20%60Hello%20there%60%3B%0A%20%20%20%20return%20greeting%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Aconst%20firstName%20%3D%20'German'%3B%0Aconst%20lastName%20%3D%20'Bencii'%3B%0A%0A%0A%0AmakeGreeting%28%29%3B&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

However, we can see that the `return` keyword also has additional effects. As well as defining the output, it also tells us to "return" to the place where in our code where the function was called.

{{<note type="activity" title="exercise">}}
Try using the visualisation diagram above to work out what happens when the computer executes the return statement.

### üß© Putting everything together

So now we have some idea of how the computer executes our code, we can apply these ideas to a program for our current implementation of `convertToPercentage`:

<iframe width="800" height="350" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=function%20convertToPercentage%28%29%20%7B%0A%20%20const%20num%20%3D%200.5%3B%0A%20%20const%20percentage%20%3D%20%60%24%7Bnum%20*%20100%7D%25%60%3B%0A%20%20return%20percentage%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Aconst%20output1%20%3D%20convertToPercentage%280.5%29%3B%0Aconst%20output2%20%3D%20convertToPercentage%280.3%29%3B&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

<br>
<br>

{{<note type="activity" title="exercise">}}
Given the code above, try using the visualisation diagrams to "play computer" with this example. Try stepping through each line of code to see what the console output is.

Explain _why_ the program is not giving the correct output we described earlier.

{{</note>}}

<br>
<br>

### Checking our code

Given our code below:

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=[7] ,linenostart=1}
function convertToPercentage() {
  const num = 0.5;
  const percentage = `${num * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}

const output1 = convertToPercentage(0.5);
const output2 = convertToPercentage(0.23);
```

when the function `convertToPercentage` is called, the variable `num` gets recreated in the `convertToPercentage` frame and set to `0.5` every time we call the function. Instead of `num` being reset every time the function is called, we want to make use of the input that is passed to the function `convertToPercentage` every time it is called.

<br>

### Parametrising a function

To make this function reusable for any number, we need to handle inputs. We do this using a **parameter**.

üîë A parameter is a variable that enables us to reference the input to a function.

We can add a parameter `num` to our function, as with the execution diagram below:

We can think of a function as a "box". We pass inputs to into it, the function's code is executed and we get an output at the end. We can visualise this as follows:

```mermaid

flowchart LR
    A[input] --> B{function}
    B --> C[output]
```

We could visualise what happens when makeGreeting is passed a specific argument:

```mermaid

flowchart LR
    A[0.23] --> B{convertToPercentage}
    B --> C[23%]
```

This time we have a difference in that we have defined a parameter `num` in the function declaration inside parentheses after the function name `convertToPercentage`. In our current mental model, a function call means going to `convertToPercentage` and running the code inside the function.

<iframe width="800" height="350" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=function%20convertToPercentage%28num%29%20%7B%0A%20%20const%20percentage%20%3D%20%60%24%7Bnum%20*%20100%7D%25%60%3B%0A%20%20return%20percentage%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Aconst%20output1%20%3D%20convertToPercentage%280.5%29%3B%0Aconst%20output2%20%3D%20convertToPercentage%280.3%29%3B&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

{{<note type="activity" title="exercise">}}
Use the visualiation digram to see what happens when the code is above is executed. Pay special attention the lines when `convertToPercentage` is called.
