For the majority of this course, we will use a custom CYF application called [CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#introduction). It uses the same visual programming editor, Block.ly, as Code.org, but you will use it to create JavaScript for real websites you can show others.

Let's all look through the interface together now, and do one exercise as a group.

{{<note title="CYF Blocks (20 minutes)" type="activity">}}

- Look at the interface together
- Everybody open the interface on their own computer as well
- Complete all steps of the first exercise
