Recall that a commit is a snapshot of our project at some point in time.

Therefore, we should be able to check out a previous version of our project and look at the files and folders there.
We can use the Github interface to check out the files and folders at a previous commit.

Go back to this page https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog/commits/main

Locate the the commit with hash `4e78b32` and then look for the icon that that says "Browse the repository at this point in the history".
Explore the code at this point in the history. What differences do you notice?
