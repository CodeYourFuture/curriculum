There are _many_ template languages. Some common ones are [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/), [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Go html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/). Once you understand one, the others are easier to pick up.
