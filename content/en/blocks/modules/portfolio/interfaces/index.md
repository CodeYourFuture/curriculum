As a team, you need to start thinking about and designing the user interface.
To focus your discussion, keep these two things in mind for your UI:

### Sufficiency

Sufficient means _enough for a given purpose_. Your user interface should provide _enough functionality or data_ for users to achieve their goals.

### Simplicity

Simple means _easy to understand_. Think of the number of times you've used a website and it's been impossible to find the things you need. Your user interface should be simple and intuitive. Users should be able to figure how to navigate and use the user interface with minimal effort.

🕰️ Time: 20 minutes

Split into pairs.
Each pair, choose a different user story.
Work on the following tasks, remember to focus on **sufficiency** and **simplicity**.

1. What kind of pages will you need?
2. What are the key components of this page (inputs, forms, buttons, cards, etc)
3. Ensure you can clearly define the purpose of each page and its components
4. What kind of data will you need to expose in this view?

### 🖼️ Wireframe

{{<note type="activity" title="discussion" >}}

🕰️ Time: 20 minutes

Create some wireframes for the pages you described in the previous section
If you've not made wireframes before, check out this guide to help you come up with some ideas: https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/

### 🪞 Reflect and check

{{<note type="activity" title="discussion" >}}

🕰️ Time: 10 minutes

Now swap wireframes between each pair.
Check the following:
Does the proposed interface meet the requirements for the user story?
Is it sufficient?
Is it simple?
