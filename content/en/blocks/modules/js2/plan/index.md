To implement the character limit component, we need to update the interface as the user types in the text area. We can outline a strategy as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit of 200] --> B[Step 2: Access the textarea element] --> C[Step 3: Calculate the number of characters left] --> D[Step 4: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

This strategy gives us a rough guide for the road ahead. However, as we learn more about this problem, we may need to update our strategy.
