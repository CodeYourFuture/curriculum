Suppose you're building a user interface for a cinema's website to display the films that are now showing. We need to render some cinema listings in the user interface. Let's define an acceptance criterion:

> _Given_ a list of film data
> _When_ the page first loads
> _Then_ it should display the list of films now showing, including the film title, times and film certificate

We can use a {{<tooltip title="wireframe">}}A wireframe is a basic outline of a web page used for design purposes{{</tooltip>}}to visualise how the user interface should look:

The wireframe is built by reusing the same{{<tooltip title="UI component">}}A **UI component** is a reusable, self-contained piece of the UI. UI components are like lego blocks you can use to build websites. Most websites are made by "composing" components in this way.{{</tooltip>}}. In particular, each film object is rendered as a card component. To build this user interface, we will start with data in the form of an array of objects, each with similar properties. Here are some example film data:

```js
const films = [
  {
    title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
    director: "Martin Scorsese",
    times: ["15:35"],
    certificate: "15",
    duration: 112
  },
  {
    title: "Typist Artist Pirate King",
    directory: "Carol Morley",
    times: ["15:00", "20:00"],
    certificate: "12A",
    duration: 108
  },
  .
  .
  .
];
```

Our task will be to build the film listings view from this list of data.
