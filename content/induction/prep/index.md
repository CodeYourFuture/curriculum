## Get Help with Expenses

If you can't afford to come to class, we can try to help. You can apply for help with:

- A laptop
- Other computer hardware like a webcam, a USB stick, or accessibility devices
- Childcare
- Internet access
- Bus and (local) train tickets
- Food on class days

These are classed as student expenses and they don't count as income for any benefits you are claiming.

{{<note type="remember" title="Ask your local manager">}}Some of this support may not be available in your region.{{</note>}}

## Check Your Laptop

Please make sure that the laptop you are using meets the [minimum specification for our course](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/leaders/joining-the-course/laptops/minimum-laptop-specs).

If your laptop does not meet the minimum specification and you cannot afford one that does, we can try to help by lending you a second-hand laptop.

We don't have an infinite number of laptops so we can't promise you one.

## Backup Your Files

Over this course we will ask you to install software or change your computer in complicated ways very often. You could end up overwriting your files by mistake, or sometimes on purpose! ::wink::

So it's important that you always have a backup. Software developers back up their computers regularly to a different location.

#### You can back up your files to:

- The Cloud (e.g. Google Drive)
- Another computer
- An external hard disk
- A USB stick

You _must not_ back-up the files simply to another folder in the same laptop. Research online to find how to backup for your computer.

## Operating System

You can complete our course on any UNIX-based Operating System. If you have a Mac, Mac OSX is UNIX based. Otherwise, we recommend that you use Linux.

We recommend using Ubuntu Linux to complete this course. If you need it, we can help you with this step.

{{<note type="warning" title="You Cannot Use Windows">}}
We don't support Windows. Don't try to use Windows on this course.

## Visual Studio Code

### Install [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeYourFuture.cyf-extension-pack)

You will use VS Code to write all of our code in the course. You should already have installed and used this application.

#### [Install these Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeYourFuture.cyf-extension-pack)

Install our [CYF extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeYourFuture.cyf-extension-pack).

{{<note type="tip" title="Lint your code with Prettier">}}
Your coursework may be rejected if you haven't formatted it with Prettier. Ask your mentors in class why!
{{</note>}}

### Enable formatting on save

Enable format on save so that your code stays formatted.

1. In Visual Studio open the settings file
2. Search for editor format
3. Set editor.formatOnSave and editor.formatOnPaste to true
4. Set the "Default Formatter" to be Prettier
