### Git

You will use Git continually as a developer.

You can open a terminal and run the command `git -v` to double check you have Git installed.
If it is installed successfully, you should get a version number (which may not be exactly the same as this example, but should look similar):

```bash
git version 2.40.0
```

Otherwise, you will need to ask for support on your Slack channel.
