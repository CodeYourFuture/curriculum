#### Congratulations, you've now reached the end of the prep content for this week ðŸŽ‰

This is now the time to reflect on your prep so far this week and identify any areas where you're struggling.

You should now do the following:

- [ ] Ensure you can define the key vocabulary for this week
- [ ] Check over the learning objectives for this week - is there anything there that looks particularly difficult?
- [ ] If you've got stuck on any of the exercises this week, be sure to ask for support on Slack and make sure you come to class with questions
