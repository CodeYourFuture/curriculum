Throughout this course, we will reference the book [How Computers Really Work](https://www.howcomputersreallywork.com/) by Matthew Justice.

You will need a copy.

The author, Matthew Justice, has kindly donated a pdf of this book for use by CodeYourFuture trainees. If you would like a copy of this PDF, you can find access details in the [#software-development-course slack channel](https://codeyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C0884D7GLS3).

If you buy your own copy [from e.g. Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Computers-Work-Hands-Workings/dp/1718500661), {{<our-name>}} cannot pay for this.

Huge thanks to Matthew Justice and the folks at No Starch Press for their kind donation of this excellent book!
