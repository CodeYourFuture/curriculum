This sprint we're going to focus on why and how we break up software into different components, such as a frontend and backend.

We will do this through a worked example. We will build a quote website, which lets people get quotes, or add quotes to a list.

We will supply most of the code for you. You should read the code and make sure you understand it. Then you should copy it onto your computer, run it, and experiment with it. Later, you will need to deploy it to the internet, and you will need to modify the code yourself.

Next sprint, you will be building your own website. It will be similar, but not the same. You will build an interactive chat room, where multiple users can chat in real-time. We will not supply the code. You will need to apply all of the skills you're learning this sprint to write and deploy the code yourself.
