This track introduces event-driven architectures using Kafka, and monitoring event-driven architectures using Prometheus.

It assumes you have already:
* Completed the [Software Development Course](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/)
* Gained enough familiarity with Docker that you can create a docker image for an application you have developed, and run it locally using `docker run`.
* Used `docker compose` to run multiple coordinated Docker containers locally.
