The strangest day plan you ever will see! This track is being delivered by our partners, [Centre for Public Impact](https://centreforpublicimpact.org/ai-opportunity-fund/). So you are spared energisers, wrap circle, retros, almost everything except community lunch.

(I do insist on community lunch.)
