## Welcome to AI Essentials.

Your goal is to complete the modules and workshops of the Google AI Essentials course, and use the skills you have learned in this to complete the CYF Roles Project. So your subgoals are to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Complete the coursework and videos included in the Coursera course
- ðŸŽ¯ Attend the in person workshops delivered by our partners, Quadmark for the Centre for Public Impact
- ðŸŽ¯ Use the skills you have learned to complete the CYF Roles Project

_Our_ goal is to find people who are ready to work in professional office roles as soon as we can find them. This doesn't mean we have a bucket of jobs to hand out ourselves, this just means we want a portfolio of good candidates to take to _potential_ employers. This means we are looking for people ready to begin working within the next 6 weeks. This is why we are looking at your ability to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Work in a team to deliver work at pace.
- ðŸŽ¯ Handle tasks and take responsibility for project delivery.
- ðŸŽ¯ Explain your work to others in English.

These are the core goals of this track.
