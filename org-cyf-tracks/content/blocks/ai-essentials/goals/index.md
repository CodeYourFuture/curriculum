## Welcome to AI Essentials.

Your goal is to complete the modules and workshops of the Google AI Essentials course. So your subgoals are to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Complete the coursework and videos included in the Coursera course
- ðŸŽ¯ Attend the in person workshops delivered by our partners, Quadmark for the Centre for Public Impact

_Our_ goal is to find people who are ready to work in professional office roles as soon as we can find them. This doesn't mean we have a bucket of jobs to hand out ourselves, this just means we want a portfolio of good candidates to take to _potential_ employers. This means we are looking for people ready to begin working within the next 6 weeks.
