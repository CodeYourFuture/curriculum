### Led by 🎩 **Meeting Leader**

We will start with a team meeting. We will introduce ourselves, identify the tasks we will take on for the day, and review the plan for our day together.

Today we will do our last workshop on the [Google AI Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-ai-essentials) course.

After the workshop, we will work on the Roles project together.

Then this afternoon we will have a little wrap party to celebrate completing the course. 🎉

But first, let’s find out who is doing what today. Everyone put your hands in the air. Wiggle those fingers! **Meeting Leader**, please begin by saying hello and then:

- your name
- what task you are responsible for today (like 🥪 Lunch, ⏰ Timekeeper, etc)
- the thing you need most help with today

Then point to someone else and ask them to do the same. Keep going until everyone has said hello and put their hands down.
