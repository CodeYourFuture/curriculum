Today we will do workshops on the [Google AI Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-ai-essentials) course. The trainer is an experienced specialist who can really help us get the most out of this course.

You should already have completed the online modules for this course. The trainer will help you to understand the content, develop and apply the skills, and answer any questions you have.
