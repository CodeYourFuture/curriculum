### Led by 🎩 **Meeting Leader**

Before you came to class today, you should have completed the prep and signed the Trainee Agreement and the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/). Please now make sure you have signed the register. Sign it as soon as you come in. The register isn’t just for attendance rules; we need to know who is in the building if there’s a fire, so please don’t sign in for anyone else.

We will start with a team meeting. We will introduce ourselves, identify the tasks we will take on for the day, and review the plan for our day together.

Today we will do **two** workshops on the [Google AI Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-ai-essentials) course. The trainer is an experienced specialist who can really help us get the most out of this course.

Then we will wrap and go for a cup of tea together.

But first, let’s get to know each other. Everyone put your hands in the air. Wiggle those fingers! **Meeting Leader**, please begin by saying hello and then:

- your name
- what task you are responsible for today (like 🥪 Lunch, ⏰ Timekeeper, etc)
- one thing you are looking forward to today

Then point to someone else and ask them to do the same. Keep going until everyone has said hello and put their hands down.
