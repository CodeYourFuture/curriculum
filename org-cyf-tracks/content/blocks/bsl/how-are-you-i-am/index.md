> Notice that we don't sign the word "are" or "am" - pointing at yourself or someone else implicitly means "I am" or "You are" if that makes sense in the sentence.

The way we answer this in BSL is by pointing at our own chest, and then signing an adjective. e.g. pointing at our chest, and then making the sign for "happy" or "sleepy" or "hungry".

Think about how you'd like to be able to answer how you are. Look up 5 different ways you may want to describe yourself. Try to remember them, and bring them to class to share with the group.
