Just like in spoken language, people don't tend to spell out words in BSL. Most of the time, people will use signs for words or ideas, rather than spelling out words. Spelling out words is time-consuming, and requires more attention to follow than individual signs.

But spelling can still be useful. People often spell names and places. Beginners also often spell words they don't know the sign for. Remember, though, when you're spelling a word, you're spelling it in English. English is a separate language to BSL. When you're spelling in English, it's like you're using a loan-word from another language.

Open [this website which shows the BSL alphabet](https://deafaction.org/bsl-courses/learn-the-bsl-alphabet/).

Copy each of the letters with your hands, one at a time. The signs shown are shown as a right-handed person would spell them - if you're left handed, swap the hands.

Pay careful attention to where _all_ of the fingers are (e.g. in the sign for "D", the dominant hand forms a C with two fingers and tucks the others away. The non-dominant hand sticks out one finger, and tucks the others away. In the "W", both hands are fully open, and in the "X", only one finger is open from each hand.)
