Get in groups of 3. Take turns in pairs within your group:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If someone uses a sign you don't understand, try to work it out together _without speaking_.

* Person 1 should say hello, say their name, and ask the other person for their name.
* Person 2 should say their name, and ask how person 1 is.
* Person 1 should say how they are, and ask how person 2 is.
* Person 2 should say how they are.

Person 3 should watch the dialogue.

After the dialogue, all three people should discuss what went well, and what could have gone better.

Keep swapping roles until everyone has introduced themselves to everyone else in the group.
