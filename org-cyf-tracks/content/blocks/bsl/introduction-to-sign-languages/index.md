A sign language is a visual means of communicating using gestures, facial expression, and body language. Sign languages are used mainly by people who are Deaf or have hearing impairments.

Just like there are different spoken languages, there are different sign languages. Even though England and America both speak English, British Sign Language and American Sign Language are quite different. American Sign Language is much closer related to French Sign Language. New Zealand Sign Language, South African Sign Language, and Auslan (used in Australia) are closer to BSL.

Also just like with spoken languages, there will be regional variations in sign languages, with local slang, dialects, and conventions.

Sign languages are their own complete languages. They have their own grammars, vocabularies, and sentence structures. They can often be more efficient than spoken language, because you can use your face, body, and actions to convey extra meaning. Some examples:
* Sign languages tend not to have/use signs for the word "very". If you wanted to sign "very hungry" you would sign hungry, but make a bigger action with your hand(s), and show more discomfort on your face.
* Sign languages often use body or hand position instead of pronouns. e.g. when reporting on a dialogue between two people, rather than saying "He said ..., I said, ..., he said ..., ..." you just shift your body position to indicate who was speaking.
