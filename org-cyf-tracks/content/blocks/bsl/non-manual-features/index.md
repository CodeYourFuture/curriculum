In spoken language, if you say "I'm happy" but with a very dull, monotonous tone while looking at the floor, people may be confused. Are you really happy? Are you lying? Are you being sarcastic? It also makes it harder for a non-native speaker to guess what you mean.

Similarly, when signing, we don't only use our hands ("manual features"). We also use other parts of our body ("non-manual features").

If we're signing that we're happy, we smile. If we're signing that we're unhappy, we frown. This is important for conveying meaning. We'll learn more about non-manual features over time, but for now remember: try to embody the meaning of what you're signing when you're signing it.

{{<note type="exercise">}}
Practice saying those "I'm ..." signs you learnt, making sure your face and body match the meaning you're expressing.
