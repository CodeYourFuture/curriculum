This has been a very short introducing to British Sign Language.

If you found this interesting, you may be interested in taking a course in BSL.

We recommend [the british-sign.co.uk course](https://www.british-sign.co.uk/) which can be taken for as little as Â£3.

There are also many in-person and online courses with live instructors throughout the UK.
