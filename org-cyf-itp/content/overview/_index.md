### Objective

The objective of this course is to give people with no prior software development experience an introduction to programming and thinking about data. Common next-steps after this course are to get an entry level job in tech or IT, or to continue learning more advanced software engineering techniques to prepare for a software engineering job.

Primarily this is achieved by teaching programming concepts with JavaScript, and data concepts with SQL.

A pre-requisite of this course is having completed [Code Your Future's Intro to Digital course](https://codeyourfuture.io/itc/) which teaches the basics of HTML and CSS.
