## ✅ To complete _this_ module, you must:

   - Follow this template for naming your issue: `<COHORT_NAME> | Structuring and testing data | <YOUR_NAME>`
1. On the issue, add:
    - Evidence you have completed at least 60% of the [Codewars katas for this module](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/27).
    - Links to your _completed_ pull requests for each sprint:
        1. "[Sprint 1 Coursework Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/35)".
        2. "[Sprint 2 Coursework Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/7)".
        3. "[Sprint 3 "Implement and Rewrite Tests" Coursework Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/6)".
        4. "[Sprint 3 "Practice TDD" Coursework Exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/695)".
    - A link to your "[Written Email for an Internship](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/20)".
    - A screenshot showing that you took part in an online study session with at least one other trainee. This could be a video call, a Slack thread, or something else!
    - A screenshot showing that you [gave a demo in a demo session with particular members of staff present](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Structuring-and-Testing-Data/issues/897).
2. Submit the issue link to step 2 of ITP on [CYF Course Portal](https://application-process.codeyourfuture.io/).

> [!NOTE]
> A pull request is _completed_ when a volunteer has added the "Complete" tag. If nobody has reviewed your PR after one week, please ask on Slack in #cyf-code-review.
