## Timeline of ITP, staying on track:

The course starts on the 1st of the month but there may be 7 days until the first Saturday, so we have written this to follow that timeline. 

There are 12 learning weeks in the curriculum, which you will schedule over a maximum of 16 weeks. This padding will help you account for things like Christmas, or Eid and other movable feasts. The course allows for variance in ability and previous experience. Most people should complete this course in 12 weeks of classes. Some will go faster (and this is encouraged). A few people will have adverse life events and need a couple of weeks to catch up. Once a learner is a full module behind, it's not realistic for them to catch up.

So that's your rule of thumb for staying on track. What does this look like in practice, week by week?

## 🫶🏽 Day 1 Week 1

Week 1: you have logged in to the dashboard to see your list of learners and welcomed them by name in Slack. You have scheduled your learning weeks in your [classplanner](https://classplanner.codeyourfuture.io/) and your volunteer team has signed up on the schedule so everybody knows the rota.  

## 🤝 Module 1: [Weeks 2, 3, 4](/onboarding)

🤝 Week 2: you have met everyone in person or at Zoomschool

- Week 2: most people have opened a PR
- Week 2: most people have gotten a code review

🤝 Week 3: 100% of learners have opened a PR or withdrawn/deferred  
🤝 Week 4: Focus on enrollment: 60% of learners have completed the [Onboarding Module](/onboarding) and enrolled as a trainee

## 🥚 Module 2: [Weeks 5, 6, 7](/structuring-data)

🥚 Week 6: Everybody has begun [Structuring and Testing Data](/structuring-data) at least as we are halfway through the course!
