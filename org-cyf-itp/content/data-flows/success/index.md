### 💯 To complete _any_ module, you must:

```objectives

- Come to class
```

## ✅ To complete _this_ module, you must:

1. Make a new issue on your own Coursework Planner.
   - Follow this template for naming your issue: `<COHORT_NAME> | Data flows | <YOUR_NAME>`
1. On the issue, add:
    - A link to your GitHub repo and deployed Netlify site for the "[TV Show Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Project-TV-Show)".
    - A link to your level 400 and level 500 pull requests for the "[TV Show Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Project-TV-Show)", to show both you and your partner contributed.
    - A link to your _completed_ pull request for "[Book Library Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Data-Flows/issues/31)", where you have responded to review feedback.
    - A link to your issue for "[LinkedIn Social Selling Index](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Data-Flows/issues/12)". Your issue must show your current index and actions you will take to improve it.
    - A screenshot showing that you took part in an online study session with at least one other trainee. This could be a video call, a Slack thread, or something else!
1. Submit the issue link to step 4 of ITP on [CYF Course Portal](https://application-process.codeyourfuture.io/).
