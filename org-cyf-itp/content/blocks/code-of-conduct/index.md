You should already have read [Code Your Future's Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) as part of signing your learner agreement. If you haven't, make sure to read it.

<details>

<summary>Facilitation tips</summary>

Some key things to aim for:

### What kind of things are against CYF's Code of Conduct?

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}. Popcorn around the room sharing examples of what behaviours are not welcome at CYF.

<details>

<summary>Facilitation tips</summary>

Some key things to aim for:

* It's important people can say no, and that's respected.
* Different people have different expectations and boundaries.
* If you're not comfortable, or not sure, it's probably a problem.
* Anyone is capable of violating the Code of Conduct - trainees, volunteers, or staff.

### What should you do if you think someone has violated the Code of Conduct?

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}. Discuss as a group what you think should happen if someone does something unwelcome towards or around you.

There isn't one good answer here. Different people will have different views.

If in doubt, anyone can (and should) report things to any member of staff. And if there isn't a response within a week, email cs@codeyourfuture.io.

But we're a community, and a lot of less severe things can be dealt with a good faith conversation between adults.

### When trainees face serious personal challenges outside of CYF

If you suspect or learn that a trainee is facing serious personal challenges or abuse outside of CYF, please tell a staff member. For example, if a trainee tells you about partner abuse. Or, if you believe they’re being financially exploited by someone.

<details>

<summary>How to Share Your Concern</summary>

1. **Write down what you observed or learned**, especially if it’s from a conversation. Try to use the other person’s words where possible.
2. **Tell a CYF Staff Member**: They will then take appropriate action.
   * We may not include you in the actions after reporting.
   * If you're hesitant, you can first share your concerns without naming the affected individual.

**Important Points to Remember**

* No Penalties for Trainees: CYF does not penalise trainees experiencing problems.
* Access to Support: CYF can share a list of organizations experienced in addressing various challenges.
* If in doubt, it's better to share your concern. It's better to ask if someone needs help and be told no, than to not ask when someone does need help.

If you are facing serious personal challenges, you can visit [the signpost directory of organisations for help](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/). Or, you can tell a CYF staff member.
