There isn't one good answer here. Different people will have different views.

If in doubt, anyone can (and should) report things to any member of staff. And if there isn't a response within a week, email cs@codeyourfuture.io.

But we're a community, and a lot of less severe things can be dealt with a good faith conversation between adults.
