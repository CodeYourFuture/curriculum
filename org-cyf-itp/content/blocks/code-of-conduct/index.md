You should already have read [Code Your Future's Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) as part of signing your learner agreement. If you haven't, make sure to read it.

### What is the purpose of a Code of Conduct?

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}. Popcorn around the room sharing ideas about what a Code of Conduct is for.

<details>

<summary>Facilitation tips</summary>

Some key things to aim for:

* Making sure people feel comfortable and welcome.
* Making clear what is/isn't appropriate.
* Helping people to learn and improve themselves.
* Stopping smaller problems from becoming big problems.

### What kind of things are against CYF's Code of Conduct?

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}. Popcorn around the room sharing examples of what behaviours are not welcome at CYF.

<details>

<summary>Facilitation tips</summary>

Some key things to aim for:

* It's important people can say no, and that's respected.
* Different people have different expectations and boundaries.
* If you're not comfortable, or not sure, it's probably a problem.
* Anyone is capable of violating the Code of Conduct - trainees, volunteers, or staff.

### What should you do if you think someone has violated the Code of Conduct?

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}. Discuss as a group what you think should happen if someone does something unwelcome towards or around you.

There isn't one good answer here. Different people will have different views.

If in doubt, anyone can (and should) report things to any member of staff. And if there isn't a response within a week, email cs@codeyourfuture.io.

But we're a community, and a lot of less severe things can be dealt with a good faith conversation between adults.

### What should you do if you are concerned about someone's welfare (even outside of CodeYourFuture)?

e.g. if you think they're being abused by their partner, or being taken advantage of?

You can report this to any member of staff who will take appropriate action. You will probably not be involved in this action after you report the concern.
