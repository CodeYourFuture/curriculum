Some of the exercises below link to the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** to a MigraCode-owned repository. We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission â€” to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercises work as intended â€” you are free to **fork and clone** the repositories as needed.

However, please **do not make any pull requests** to the original Code Your Future repositories.
