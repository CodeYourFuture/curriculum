### Overview

Participants are required to score 100 or higher on the Duolingo English Practice Test, which corresponds to CEFR level B2. We set this level because we have learned from experience that participants without it are unable to follow the course materials in subsequent courses.

**We want you to succeed.** If you have not yet reached this level, it is better to work on your English _first_, then apply to us when you are _ready_.


### What Should You Do?

##### 1. Preparation

1. Find 50 minutes where you will not be interrupted.
2. [Register on the Duolingo website](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/register) to do the Practice Test.
3. You need to look at your camera during some exercises, so test that your camera and microphone are working. You may need to do this test on your phone.

##### 2. Take the test

1. Go to the [Duolingo Practice Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/test/practice) page.
2. Take the test, which will be around 45 minutes.
3. Take a screenshot of your result.

##### 3. Upload your result
Upload your screenshot in Step 7 on the [CYF Course Platform](https://application-process.codeyourfuture.io/).
