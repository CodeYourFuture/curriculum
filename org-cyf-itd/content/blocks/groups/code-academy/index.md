This short 60 minute case study from Code Academy explains how to prompt an AI to generate a customised CV for a particular job. It is suitable for beginners. It has a link to a pre-course for people who have never tried Chat GPT before.

Volunteers should prepare for this session by completing the case study themselves. Your goal is to guide learners to explore achieving specific outcomes with the AI, rather than just following the instructions. Also reflect on the risks of using AI to generate CVs.
