Discuss the goals of a cover letter. Come up with examples of things that should and shouldn't be in a cover letter.

Discuss what makes for good and bad professional writing. Come up with examples of how to write well in a professional context, and things to avoid.

Look at someone's example generated cover letter (or have ChatGPT generate one to use in the workshop) and reflect on it together.

How well does it achieve the goals of a cover letter? How professional is the writing? What things does it do badly? How does it make the applicant stand out compare to other generic letters?
