CYF Blocks is a custom application of the [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) library. It is a visual programming language that allows you to create programs by dragging and dropping blocks. This course has been developed specifically for {{our-name}} learners to build a foundation in programming concepts.

Volunteers, please prepare by completing some of the lessons in CYF Blocks. You can find the course at the link above. Establish a basic understanding of the course content and the types of exercises learners will complete.
