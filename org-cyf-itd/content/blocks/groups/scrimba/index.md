The Scrimba course is an interactive video series where trainees build and deploy a sequence of static HTML and CSS sites.

Your job is to facilitate learners to work together on their projects. You can answer questions and unblock people, but keep your hands off the keyboard and let the applicants lead.

The capstone project is the Hometown Homepage. This is much more self directed than the previous steps and supporting learners to explore HTML and CSS is really key here.

The final stage of the Scrimba course is to seek a code review. We ask learners to do this in Slack using a simple template. Volunteers should lead code review and make sure every learner receives at least one code review in Slack. This can be as few as 50 words.

When learners have completed the course, support them to give other learners on this step code review in Slack.
