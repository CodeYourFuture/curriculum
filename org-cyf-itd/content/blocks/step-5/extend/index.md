#### Use your new skill in real life:

This step is just for you. You don't need to submit it.

Now that your webpage is live, you can make it even better by adding images and organizing your files like a developer. Try uploading your own images to your repository and updating your HTML so they appear on your site. You can also create folders (for example, `/images` or `/css`) to keep your project tidy. This is how professional developers structure their projects, and it will make your code easier to manage as your website grows.
