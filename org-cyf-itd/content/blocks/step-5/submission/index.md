### Submission

There are two things to submit here.

1. Share _one_ project. For example, once you have completed* Project: Build an image carousel*, press the [Share] button and paste the very very long URL in here. The URL will begin with `https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/share.html?v=`

2. The **goal** is to use the generated code to add a {{<tooltip title="dynamic feature">}}A dynamic feature means the website changes with some input or interaction.{{</tooltip>}} to your own project. Copy paste your block-generated code into a single `.js` file and add it, with the html and css, to your Hometown Homepage project. Share the link to your improved website.
