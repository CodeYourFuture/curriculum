<summary>I don't have a computer</summary>
Here are some ways MigraCode solved this problem in the past:

1. Use a computer in a local library.

1. Borrow a computer from a friend or a relative if you can.

1.  If you are accepted as a students you can borrow a laptop for the entirety of the bootcamp- which you can take home. Let us know you need one at barcelona@migracode.org or text us on the MigraCode Slack.
