We have written this criteria in a special format called _Given/When/Then_ . It is called a "specification".

Here are the acceptance criteria for your project:

### Given a personal home page

**When** I look in the test console  
_Then_ all 10 tests are passing

**When** I read the content  
_Then_ I learn something about you

**When** I view the page  
_Then_ the design is unique

**When** I [validate the HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options)  
_Then_ the HTML is valid

> [!TIP]
> Your work is not judged on aesthetics in this project. We are interested in code correctness and specification compliance.
