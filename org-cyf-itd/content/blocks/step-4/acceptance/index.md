We have written this criteria in a special format called _Given/When/Then_ . It is called a "specification".

Here are the acceptance criteria for your project:

### Given a personal home page

{{<objectives>}}

- [ ] When I look in the test console  
       Then all 10 tests are passing
- [ ] When I read the content  
       Then I learn something about you
- [ ] When I view the page  
       Then the design is unique
- [ ] When I [validate the HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options)  
       Then the HTML is valid

{{</objectives>}}

> [!TIP]
> Your work is not judged on aesthetics in this project. We are interested in code correctness and specification compliance.
