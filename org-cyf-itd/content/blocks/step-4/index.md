This short course from Google will teach you how to analyse and visualise data in Google Sheets. It is suitable for beginners. Come to [CYF workshops](./workshops) to get help and to work with other applicants on your project. If you do not have a computer, find your nearest free online centre.

Complete the course and share a link to the final spreadsheet you made. You can move on to the next step as soon as you have shared the link. You don't need to wait.

### Personalise your URLs

Before you share your link with your mentors, edit your Google Spreadsheet name to include your **name**. It can just be your given name or your family name if you prefer.
