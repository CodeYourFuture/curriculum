### Overview

In this exercise, you will:
- Build your first webpage using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Practice editing your webpage and instantly see results
- Share your work with others using **CodePen**


### What Should You Do?

#### 1. Sign up a CodePen account

[CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) is an online playground where you can:
- Write HTML and CSS code
- See the results instantly
- Share your work with others

ðŸ‘‰ While you are learning, CodePen lets you experiment and get instant feedback.

#### 2. Learn HTML and CSS

You can use any resource you like, but here are two free and beginner-friendly options:

##### Option 1: Khan Academy

- [Create an account on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)
- Take the course: [Computer Programming: Unit 2: Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)

##### Option 2: W3Schools

- [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

##### How much do I need to learn?

Here is a self-checklist to check if you understand HTML and CSS well enough to produce the webpage in this Step.

âœ… **HTML Basics**

- [ ] I know what HTML is used for.
- [ ] I know how `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` make up the basic structure of an HTML document.
- [ ] I can add a **title** inside the `<head>` tag.
- [ ] I know these key terminologies: **element**, **tag**, **attribute**, **opening tag**, **closing tag**.
- [ ] I can add text using `<h1>` to `<h6>` headings and `<p>` paragraphs.
- [ ] I can add a **link** with `<a href="...">`.
- [ ]  I can add an **image** with `<img src="..." alt="...">`.
- [ ] I can create a **list** using `<ul>` (unordered) or `<ol>` (ordered) with `<li>`.
- [ ] I know how to group content with `<div>` and highlight text with `<span>`.
- [ ] I know the differences between **block-level** and **inline** elements (e.g., `<div>` vs `<span>`).

âœ… **CSS Basics**
- [ ] I know what CSS is used for.
- [ ] I can connect CSS to HTML using a `<style>` tag or an external `.css` file.
- [ ] I understand the advantages of specifying CSS styles in an external `.css` file.
- [ ] I understand the basic structure of a CSS rule.
- [ ] I know how to select elements using 
    - **Element selectors** (e.g., `p`)
    - **Class selectors** (e.g., `.classname`)
    - **ID selectors** (e.g., `#idname`)
- [ ] I can change text **color**, **size**, and **font** with CSS.
- [ ] I can change the **background color** of a page or element.
- [ ] I can add **borders**, **margins**, and **padding**.
- [ ] I can center text and image.

#### 3. Prepare a webpage on CodePen

Your webpage should meet all of the following criteria:

- It is about something you like (e.g., a hobby, a city, a person, an animal, a flower, or food).
- It contains **at least 100 words**.
- It includes **at least three images**, and **at least one image must be centered** on the page:
  - The image should remain centered regardless of the ***viewport*** **width**.
  - Free-tier CodePen users cannot upload images. Use **publicly accessible image URLs** instead.
- It includes an **ordered** (`<ol>`) or **unordered** (`<ul>`) list.
- All CSS should be written **inside the CSS tab** on CodePen (not inline).
- Both HTML and CSS should be **free of syntax errors**.

{{<note type="tip" title="Using AI to help you understand and fix coding errors">}}
If you do not know how to fix an error in your code, show your code to AI and ask it to help you understand the cause of the error.

Remember that the purpose of this exercise is learning - you shouldn't have AI write code for you. But it can help you understand problems.

#### 4. Submit your CodePen page link  

Submit the link to your CodePen page in Step 4 on the [CYF Course Platform](https://application-process.codeyourfuture.io/).


### Important Notes About CodePen

- When writing your code in CodePen, you do not need to include `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags (the editor adds them automatically).

- CodePen has built-in features to help you check your code for errors:
  - **Analyze HTML** â†’ checks your HTML for mistakes
  - <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/03/analyze-before-option.png" alt="HTML Analyzer" width="600">
  - **Analyze CSS** â†’ checks your CSS for mistakes
