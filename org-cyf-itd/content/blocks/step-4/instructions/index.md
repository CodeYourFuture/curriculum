You must now build your own home page, and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal touch. We know that people who do well on our courses show **creativity**, **curiosity**, **persistence**, and **rigour**. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re looking for from you in this project.

1. Make a free account on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
2. [Fork](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/forks/) the CYF starter page[ Personal Home Page Template ](https://codepen.io/IntroToTech/pen/PomeEod)
3. Read the instructions in the code panels and edit the code to meet all the criteria you discover

Use HTML and CSS to complete this project. Codepen has options to use extensions like SASS and Pug and feel free to use those if you want!

> [!TIP]
> Make sure youâ€™re [logged in to Codepen](https://codepen.io/your-work) when you [fork](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/forks/) so your work is saved.

### Advice

**Use and read the tests** to discover the other 10 requirements. Build, test, and improve your code progressively. The tests are written in the Javascript window in Codepen for you to see, and thereâ€™s a readout in the main view showing the results. Donâ€™t worry that you donâ€™t understand the brackets and arrows, **read the words**. The tests will rerun every time you make a change in your code.

Once you're done, submit the URL of your working project with all its tests passing, to the dashboard.
