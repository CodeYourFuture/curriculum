You must now build your own home page, and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal touch. We know that people who do well on our courses show **creativity**, **curiosity**, **persistence**, and **rigour**. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re looking for from you in this project.

### Steps 
1. **Create a free CodePen account** 
   here: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

2. **Build your webpage using HTML and CSS**  
   - Add navigation bar 
   - Display one image
   - Apply all the skills you learned during the course

3. **When finished, send us the direct link to your CodePen webpage.**  
   Projects that meet the acceptance criteria will allow you to move on to the final step of the MigraCode application process.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure youâ€™re [logged in to CodePen](https://codepen.io/your-work) when you [fork](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/forks/) so your work is saved.

### Advice

**Use and read the tests** to discover the other 10 requirements. Build, test, and improve your code progressively. The tests are written in the Javascript window in Codepen for you to see, and thereâ€™s a readout in the main view showing the results. Donâ€™t worry that you donâ€™t understand the brackets and arrows, **read the words**. The tests will rerun every time you make a change in your code.

Once you're done, submit the URL of your working project with all its tests passing, to the dashboard.
