- You have used the same name on the Slack as you have on this platform so we can tell who you are
- You have introduced yourself on the #introduce-yourself-to-migracode channel
- You have taken a screenshot of your introduction on the channel
- You have sent the screenshot along with the other later requirements in an email to barcelona@migracode.org
```
