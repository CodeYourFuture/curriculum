### Join the MigraCode Intro To Digital Slack

We have an environment in which you can ask for help and build your local community. Slack helps us have asynchronous conversations with our community. It is used by most tech teams.
By this time you should have already received an invitation to our Slack channel.

If you havenâ€™t already accepted the invite to the `itd-2025` channel, please do so by [clicking here](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtOTAyODE2MzU5OTg1Ni0xM2U5YmQzZGJmZGU2YjQwOWU0NzE2ZDBmN2JhNjRkNjdhYTU2YjJjODEyNjNjZmJiNjJhZWE2Y2JlYzNjMDll).

Please use a professional name on Slack and add a consistent profile picture. We ask this so we can recognise each other. You don't have to share any information you are not comfortable with. After having joined make sure to:

 - Introduce yourself on the itd-2025 channel so we know you have successfully joined and are working on your application. In the introduction, tell us your name, where you are from as well as (this step is optional) a fun fact about you!

 - E.g. "Hi everyone! My name is Amanda- but you can call me Mandy. I am from Uruguay and before migrating to Spain I was running an animal shelter in my home country. Excited to get started with web development ðŸ˜Š"
