#### Join the CodeYourFuture Intro To Digital Slack  
We have an environment in which you can ask for help and build your local community. Slack helps us have asynchronous conversations with our community. It is used by most tech teams.

Please use your real name on Slack and add a consistent profile picture. We ask this so we can recognise each other.

2. [Understand how Slack works with their tutorial](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide)
3. Introduce yourself on the [#introduce-yourself-to-codeyourfuture channel](https://cyf-introtodigital.slack.com/archives/CQ8HYL25C)
