### Join the MigraCode Intro To Digital Slack

We have an environment in which you can ask for help and build your local community. Slack helps us have asynchronous conversations with our community. It is used by most tech teams.
By this time you should have already received an invitation to our Slack channel which will automatically put you into all relevant slack channels.

Please use a consistent professional name on Slack and add a consistent profile picture. We ask this so we can recognise each other. You don't have to share any information you are not comfortable with. After having joined make sure to:

 - Introduce yourself on the itd-2025 channel so we know you have successfully joined and are working on your application. In the introduction tell us your name, where you are from as (this step is optional) a fun fact about you!

 - E.g. "Hi everyone! My name is Amanda- but you can all me Mandy. I am from Uruguay and before migrating to Spain I was running an animal shelter in my home country. Exited to get started with web development ðŸ˜Š"

If you have not yet received an invite to our Slack channel, please send a message to barcelona@migracode.org
