### Join the MigraCode Intro To Digital Slack

We have an environment in which you can ask for help and build your local community. Slack helps us have asynchronous conversations with our community. It is used by most tech teams.

Please use a consistent professional name on Slack and add a consistent profile picture. We ask this so we can recognise each other. You don't have to share any information you are not comfortable with.

1. [Read the Slack tutorial](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide) to get started on Slack
2. Introduce yourself on the [#introduce-yourself-to-migracode channel]
3. Make a screenshot of your introduction on our Slack channel
4. Upload the screenshot to this platform

> [!TIP]
> If you don't know how to take a screenshot from your device, [Take a screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/android.html) can help you.
