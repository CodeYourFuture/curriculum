At {{<our-name>}} we believe in empowering our learners by providing them with the support and guidance they need to excel. We work to achieve this by encouraging learners to work together in teams and to practice problem solving together to overcome challenges. This builds the fundamental skills needed to learn and succeed on any of our courses and also in a professional career.

Some principles should be applied when supporting people on this course:

**Be positive** build on learners’ successes.

**Be patient** and understanding: learners on this course come from a variety of backgrounds and it may take some longer than others to accomplish tasks.

**Encourage self-learning** and teamwork: learners should be encouraged to work together to solve problems, these skills are vital for long-term success.

**Praise and support**: the main objective of the ITD course is to build the confidence of learners and show them that they are capable of learning these skills.

**Encourage everyone** to talk: leaving questions open to answer will lead to only a few people dominating the conversation. Try to encourage everybody to participate by inviting individuals to answer direct questions.
