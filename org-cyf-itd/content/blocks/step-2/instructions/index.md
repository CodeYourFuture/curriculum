### Overview

- **Cover letters** are short documents sent alongside your CV. They introduce you and tell the person reviewing your application why youâ€™re perfect for the job. Not all job applications need a cover letter, but when needed, an excellent cover letter is critical.

- **Generative AI tools** like ChatGPT can help with drafting these documents as long as youâ€™re careful. Copying text from ChatGPT without reviewing it is a bad idea, as it tells lies. It's especially important to be mindful of how you use it in an educational context. ChatGPT can make you think youâ€™re progressing when youâ€™re not. Copying straight from it won't help you learn.

- In this step, your goal is to use ChatGPT to help you prepare a cover letter for a fictional person named Jane Doe using the data we provide. You donâ€™t need to understand the technical terms in the following pieces of text to complete the task.

### What Should You Do?

##### 1. Sign up for a ChatGPT account 
Go to https://chatgpt.com and sign up for an account.

##### 2. Ask the AI to help you write a cover letter

Give it the description of Jane and the job description. Chat with the AI interactively as if it is a person. It may take some experimentation to get the right prompt. Thatâ€™s OK - getting AI to do what you want is all about trial and error.

> [!NOTE]
> Think about [the goals of a cover letter](https://hbr.org/2014/02/how-to-write-a-cover-letter). Read and reflect on the cover letter. Has the AI provided good links between Jane's experience and the job's requirements (e.g. does it note that she has experience in the legal sector)? How has the AI demonstrated that Jane has the right skills for the job? Has the AI added anything that wasnâ€™t in the description of Jane? Could you do better?
>
> Think about your own future job hunt. What have you learned that will help you apply for jobs in the future? Will you use ChatGPT to help you generate a cover letter? If so, how will you make sure it's a good cover letter? If not, why not?

##### 3. Prepare the cover letter in a Google Doc

1. Create a Google Doc.
2. Copy the cover letter text from ChatGPT into the Google Doc.
3. Format the cover letter in the Google Doc.
