## 🧠 What you need to pass this module

- ⏱️ **Course Duration**: ~5.7 hours  
- 🧩 **Full Completion Time**: 10–15 hours (with projects and challenges)
- ⚡ **Requirement to pass**: A screenshot of all having watched all parts of the course and the deployment of the Birthday GIFt Site. Do not worry if your course copletion does not show 100%, as long as you have above 90% in all the projects, we consider this completed, as we know that some exercises are only available to PRO members. 


⚠️ **Note: You do not need to pay for Scrimba! It is a free resource except for the "solo project" which we are skipping. In general you are not required to hand in scrims, but rather to watch the videos and learn** ➡️
<br><br>

### 💪 Just in case it was not clear yet...
- All projects except the Hometown Homepage are mandatory for passing into the next round, (but you do not have to hand all of them in, just show you have watched the videos).
- The Birthday GIFt Site needs to be deployed externally, you will need to have created your own files on your local machine.
- For that it will be necessary for you to download VSCode to edit code and make a free Netlify account to deploy your site at the end- follow instructions on the Scrimba course.
- In the case that you need assistance, do not hesitate to contact us on Slack (view help section) - asking for help will not impact your application negatively (quite the opposite, we believe in sharing blockers and helping one another in the MigraCode community!)

✅ A **screenshot showing above 90% of course completion** and **a link to your deplyed GIFt Site** is enough — no official Scrimba certificate is required (no need to pay for the PRO version of Scrimba)!
