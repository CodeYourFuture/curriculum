   - Only the "Create Filters and Use Filter Views" section

**Note**: If you want to practice with the Google Sheets used in the videos, you can access them through the YouTube links.

##### Apply What You Learned 

1. Make a copy of [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uPnnoEbn_YdMp_Wx4oTFgIAV7E5zd8ubFZ_e4Od_pn4/copy?usp=sharing)

1. In your own copy, replace "YOUR_NAME" in the title with your own name

1. Row and Column insertion, and AutoFill
    - Insert a column before column A
    - Insert a row before row 1
    - Enter "Shirt Sales Information" in cell B1 and set the font size to 24
    - Use AutoFill to fill cells A4:A103 with the numbers 1 to 100

1. Format and Freeze Headers
    - Fill rows 1-3 with three different background colors
    - Change the font weight of rows 1-3 to bold
    - Center the text in rows 2-3
    - Freeze rows 1-3 so they remain visible at the top when scrolling vertically

1. Edit Cells
    - Enter "Sale ID" in cell A3
    - Enter "Other Information" in cell K2
    - Change the value in cell K3 to "Payment"
    - Change the value in cell L3 to "Source"

1. Merge Cells
    - Merge cells E2:G2 (three cells, from E2 to G2)
    - Merge cells H2:J2 (three cells, from H2 to J2)
    - Merge cells K2:L2 (two cells, K2 and L2)

1. Adjust Columns and Delete Unwanted Columns
    - Adjust column widths to remove extra space
    - Delete all columns beyond column L (do not delete column L)

1. Apply Border
    - Apply top and bottom borders to rows 2-3
    - Apply left and right borders to columns A-D
    - Apply right borders to columns G, J, and L
    - On row 1, clear all borders except the bottom border
    - On row 3, apply borders to every cell

1. Apply Filter
    - Use filters to show only rows that satisfy both of the following conditions:
      - Condition 1: Point of Sale is London or Glasgow
      - Condition 2: Date is between 1 June 2024 and 31 December 2024
    - Use a filter to order the rows by Date in ascending order
