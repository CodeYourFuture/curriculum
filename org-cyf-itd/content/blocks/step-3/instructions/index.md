> ⚠️ **Note:** You do not need to pay for Scrimba! It is a free resource *except* for the "solo project" which we are skipping ➡️

### 💪 Just in case it was not clear yet...
- All projects except the Hometown Homepage are *mandatory* for passing into the next round.
- The Birthday GIFt Site needs to be deployed externally, you will need to have created your own files on your local machine.
- In the case that you need assistance, do not hesitate to contact us on Slack (view help section) - asking for help will not impact your application negatively (quite the opposite, we believe in sharing blockers and helping one another in the MigraCode community)

>✅ A **screenshot showing course completion** and **a link to your deplyed GIFt Site** is enough — no official Scrimba certificate is required!
