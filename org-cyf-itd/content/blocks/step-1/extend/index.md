#### Use your new skill in real life:

This step is just for you. You don't need to submit it. Next, revise your own CV to target a job you are looking for in real life.

{{<note type="tip" title="Be careful with Generative AI">}}
Remember, your _real_ CV must only say _true_ things. (Lying on your CV is a crime in the UK!) Make sure you only use the AI to help you write your CV, not to write it for you.
