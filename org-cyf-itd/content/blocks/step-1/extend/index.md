#### Use your new skill in real life:

You do not have to complete this part of the task, but you might find it interesting or useful. Please don’t submit the result - it will lead to your submission being rejected.

You can ask ChatGPT to generate a CV for Jane using her summary. There isn’t quite enough information there for the AI to do a perfect job, so it might guess.

You could also ask it to generate a CV for you. [This course by CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/streamline-resume-creation-with-generative-ai-case-study) might be helpful in getting AI to make a CV. But, please do note that the sample prompts in the course do not always work.

{{<note type="tip" title="Be careful with Generative AI">}}
Remember, your _real_ CV must only say _true_ things. (Lying on your CV is a crime in the UK!) Make sure you only use the AI to help you write your CV, not to write it for you.

Do not give ChatGPT personal information (e.g. your phone number, email address, full name).
