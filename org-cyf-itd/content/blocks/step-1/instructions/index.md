#### Generate a Cover Letter with ChatGPT
##### Overview
Cover letters are short documents sent alongside your CV. They introduce you and tell the person reviewing your application why you’re perfect for the job. Not all job applications need a cover letter. But, when needed, an excellent cover letter is critical.

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can help with drafting these documents as long as you’re careful. Copying text from ChatGPT without reviewing it is a bad idea, as it tells lies. It's especially important to be mindful of how you use it in an educational context. ChatGPT can make you think you’re progressing when you’re not. Copying straight from it won't help you learn.

This step is all about getting ChatGPT, a generative AI software, to help you make a cover letter for Jane Doe. Jane is a fictional person who has completed a software development programme. Jane is applying for a Junior Software Developer role with Software for Lawyers Ltd.

You don’t need to understand the technical terms in these two pieces of text to complete the task.
