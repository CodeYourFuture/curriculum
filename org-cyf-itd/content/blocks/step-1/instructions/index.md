### Generate a Cover Letter with ChatGPT

## Overview

Cover letters are short documents sent alongside your CV. They introduce you and tell the person reviewing your application why you’re perfect for the job. Not all job applications need a cover letter. But, when needed, an excellent cover letter is critical.

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can help with drafting these documents as long as you’re careful. Copying text from ChatGPT without reviewing it is a bad idea, as it tells lies. It's especially important to be mindful of how you use it in an educational context. ChatGPT can make you think you’re progressing when you’re not. Copying straight from it won't help you learn.

This step is all about getting ChatGPT, a generative AI software, to help you make a cover letter for Jane Doe. Jane is a fictional person who has completed a software development programme. Jane is applying for a Junior Software Developer role with Software for Lawyers Ltd.

You don’t need to understand the technical terms in these two pieces of text to complete the task.

She taught herself the Python programming language before starting the course.

## Steps

1. Go to https://chatgpt.com and signup for an account
2. Ask the AI to help you write a cover letter. Give it the description of Jane and the job description provided. It may take some experimentation to get the right prompt. That’s OK: getting AI to do what you want is all about trial and error.
3. Think about [the goals of a cover letter](https://hbr.org/2014/02/how-to-write-a-cover-letter). Read and reflect on the cover letter. Has the AI provided good links between Jane's experience and the job's requirements (e.g. does it note that she has experience in the legal sector)? How has the AI demonstrated that Jane has the right skills for the job? Has the AI added anything that wasn’t in the description of Jane? Could you do better?
4. Think about your own future job hunt. What have you learned that will help you apply for jobs in the future? Will you use ChatGPT to help you generate a cover letter? If so, how will you make sure it's a good cover letter? If not, why not?
5. Create a Google doc with the text of the cover letter you generated. If this platform is new to you, there is this [guide on what Google docs is and how to use it](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7068618?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) available.
6. Please put your name in the title of the Google doc and **make it public**. You can add just your given name or your family name if you prefer.
7. Add the link to the Google doc to this platform
8. Add a comment *on the Migracode Barcelona Course Platform* with feedback (positive or negative) on the text the AI has generated. It should not be a general comment about AI or your feelings about using AI; it should be your own evaluation of the text you are submitting.
