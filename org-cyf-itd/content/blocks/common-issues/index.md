{{<note type="tip" title="MigraCode is a Community">}}
Remember, MigraCode is a community of adults sharing skills. We are all here to help each other, and _learn_. You are meant to ask questions at Code Your Future.

When you see someone else has a question, help them if you can.

### More common issues

<details>
<summary>I don't have a computer</summary>
Here are some ways MigraCode solved this problem in the past:

1. Use a computer in a local library.

1. Borrow a computer from a friend or a relative if you can.

1. Use one of our laptops while at our office at Carrer del Rec 27 in Barcelona. We do not have enough laptops to borrow to all of the prospective students, therefore we can only lend you a laptop once you are enrolled. If you are accepted as a students you can borrow a laptop for the entirety of the bootcamp- which you can take home.
