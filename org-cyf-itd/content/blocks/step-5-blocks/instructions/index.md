1. Go to the [CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#introduction) page:
1. Read the [instructions](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#introduction)
1. Complete lessons 1 through 16
1. Build at least one project
1. Use what you learned to improve your Hometown Homepage. Add at least one dynamic element to your page. For example, you could add a menu that opens when you click a button, or a counter that adds stars to your page.
1. Make a Google docs document with a link to your improved Hometown Homepage and a CYF Blocks sharelink from a project you have completed.

> [!TIP]
> Use [the examples section](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/examples#understanding_cyf_blocks_interface) to help you understand how to use blocks.

1. Share _one_ project. For example, once you have completed* Project: Build an image carousel*, press the [Share] button and paste the very very long URL in here. The URL will begin with `https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/share.html?v=`

2. The **goal** is to use the generated code to add a {{<tooltip title="dynamic feature">}}A dynamic feature means the website changes with some input or interaction.{{</tooltip>}} to your own project. Copy paste your block-generated code into a single `.js` file and add it, with the html and css, to your Hometown Homepage project. Share the link to your improved website.
