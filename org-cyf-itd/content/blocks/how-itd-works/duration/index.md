# Welcome from Tony

# The information you will find here is the information I found useful as a volunteer helping with the Introduction to Digital programme.

### Introduction

# The Introduction to Digital course is known as ITD. You can find an overview of how ITD works here [https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/how-itd-works/](https://itd.codeyourfuture.io/how-itd-works/)

# The role of volunteers is to review submissions by applicants and respond with feedback. The submissions will be found on the Dashboard. See the side menu for the instructions on how to access the dashboard.

We estimate that completing all of **ITD takes around 30 hours**.  
However, we are all different. Some may finish in 15 hours, others may need 50. That’s okay! What matters is consistency and effort.

💡 **Tip**: Plan ahead. Review the content, understand what is required, and allocate time according to your schedule and responsibilities.

📅 **Next Web Dev Course starts**: Mid September 2025  
📌 **Deadline to submit ITD**: **July 30th, 2025**

> ⚠️ Submissions after this date **will not be considered** for the September 2025 batch.
