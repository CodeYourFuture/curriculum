## 🧭 What is ITD?

When people [sign up to study](https://migracode.org/web-development-course/) on our website, they are sent an email with a series of instructions to follow in order to join our courses.

If we have approved your Motivational Letter, you will receive an email linking to this current page: **Intro to Digital (ITD)**, and directing you to finish it before we can consider your application for the final selection steps.

You can think of ITD as:

1. The first requirement to access our program  
2. An opportunity to try coding and test if you like it  
3. A way for the MigraCode team to set the expectations on how our courses work  
4. The baseline knowledge that we expect from all our students. This way we can ensure a balanced class.

## 🛠️ How does ITD work?

**Intro to Digital is a course itself.** Therefore, dedicate enough time to complete it and ensure to pay attention all the way through.

> 💡 **Remember** that everyone joining MigraCode Courses is expected to know the basics we cover here. Don’t skip any steps.

In ITD you will find **4 steps** — or **5, counting Step 0**. You will need to complete them all in order for us to consider your application and invite you to an interview.

**Your work will be evaluated by our team**, and based on it, we will decide whether to continue with your application.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

In ITD we want to cover the basics needed to start your journey in IT.

Once you’ve joined our Slack channel and introduced yourself, you’ll follow a series of steps covering essential concepts:

1. How to use Slack and search engines  
2. Data analysis and evaluation using Google Sheets  
3. Learn HTML and CSS  
4. Build a personal portfolio  

👀 **Note**: During our bootcamp we do *not* teach HTML and CSS in depth. Most of it will be covered in the ITD course, but there’s always more to explore — be curious and learn as much as you can!
