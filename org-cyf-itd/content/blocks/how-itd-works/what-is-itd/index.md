### What is ITD

When people [sign up to study](https://migracode.org/web-development-course/) on our website, they are invited to begin our Intro To Digital (ITD) Course. This course opens for two months.

Learners complete the course by following the sequence of steps found in this page. Each step is explained clearly in English.

In order for you to enter our courses (Web Development, AWS...) you need to do all **the steps** and share the content with us. After the submission has been done, you will be invited to an interview with our team.

While doing this course, you can join our Slack channel for ITD and get support on specific 
Volunteers review the submissions and guide learners via:

1. the comment threads on the dashboard
1. our Slack workspace for ITD
1. [drop-in sessions](./workshops) organised in-person or online by respective regional CYF teams
1. calling and SMS messaging directly from the dashboard

If you'd like to help, please [sign up as a volunteer](https://codeyourfuture.io/volunteer/).
