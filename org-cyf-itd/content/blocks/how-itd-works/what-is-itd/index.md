### What is ITD

When people [sign up to study](https://codeyourfuture.io/itc/) on our website, they are invited to begin our Intro To Digital (ITD) Course. This course lasts one month, and runs 5 times a year.

Learners complete the course on our [Guided Learning platform](https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/) by completing a sequence of steps. Each step is explained clearly in B1 English. The text is reproduced on this site in the [Steps](./steps) section.

These submissions are passed to our internal dashboard, where volunteers can track the progress of each person and help them move forward.

Volunteers review the submissions and guide learners via:

1. the comment threads on the dashboard
1. our Slack workspace for ITD
1. [drop-in sessions](./workshops) organised in-person or online by respective regional CYF teams
1. calling and SMS messaging directly from the dashboard

If you'd like to help, please [sign up as a volunteer](https://codeyourfuture.io/volunteer/).
