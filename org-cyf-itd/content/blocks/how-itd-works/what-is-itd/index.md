When people [sign up to study](https://migracode.org/web-development-course/) on our website, they are sent an email with a series of instructions to follow in order to join our courses.

If we have approved your Motivational Letter, you will receive an email linking to this current page: Intro to Digital (ITD), and directing you to finish it before we can consider your application for the final selection steps.

You can think of ITD as:

1. The first requirement to access our program
2. An opportunity to try coding and test if you like it
3. A way for the MigraCode team to set the expectations on how our courses work
4. The baseline knowledge that we expect from all our students. This way we can ensure a balanced class.
