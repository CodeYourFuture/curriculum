## Welcome from Tony

The information you will find here is the information I found useful as a volunteer helping with the Introduction to Digital programme.

### Introduction

The Introduction to Digital course is known as ITD. You can find an overview of how ITD works here [https://cyf-itd.netlify.app/how-itd-works/](https://cyf-itd.netlify.app/how-itd-works/)

The role of volunteers is to review submissions by applicants and respond with feedback. The submissions will be found on the Dashboard. See the side menu for the instructions on how to access the dashboard.
