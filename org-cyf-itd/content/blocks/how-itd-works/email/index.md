**Subject: ITD Assignment Submission â€“ Web Development Course Application**

Dear MigraCode Recruitment Committee,

I am writing to submit my responses to the ITD assignment as part of the application process for the Web Development course.

First of all, I confirm that I have introduced myself on the `#itd-2025` Slack channel.

Please find below all the required materials:



  **Step 3a.** Screenshot showing course completion (all four projects except the Hometown project need to be at close to 100% completion): `[paste the screenshot here]`

  **Step 3b.** Link to my deployed GIFt Site:  `[paste the URL here]`

  **Step 4.** Link to my personal portfolio on CodePen: `[paste the URL here]`



If you require any further information, do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,  
`[Name and Surname]`
