**How long does the ITD take?**

We estimate that finalising the whole of **ITD takes around 30h**. However, we are all different, we have different backgrounds and different ways of doing things. We also have different situations and some of us can dedicate more time to learn, while other need to balance work, family, other studies… 

Either if it takes you 15 hours or 50 hours, we want to hear from you and check your work 💪

Our recommendation is to plan ahead. Before starting review briefly all the content, check everything you will need to do and consider your other obligations. Then you can start and allocate time to do the coursework.

Currently we are planning to start our next Web Dev Course in mid September of 2025. 

The **deadline to submit** all the assignments included here in ITD is: **July 30th, 2025.**


> [!NOTE]
> Any submission past that deadline won’t be considered for the batch of September 2025
