  - technical expertise in some of the full stack development technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, SQL (Postgres)

CYF generally uses (Ubuntu) Linux rather than Windows or Macs. If you are trying to complete tasks that the applicants will do, instructions generally assume a Linux environment, so some experience of Linux would be helpful.
