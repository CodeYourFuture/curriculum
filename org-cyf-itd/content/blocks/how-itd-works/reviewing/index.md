## Important

Reviewing work submitted by the applicants is a core task for volunteers. You should prioritise reviewing submitted work when you have free time available. We will also have online sessions on Saturdays for ITD so please check in slack to find the details of those. The links should be posted into the channel and on the global channel.

The Slack channel `#cyf-intro-to-digital-course` is for volunteers to discuss and ask questions, for example if you have questions about reviewing applicants work. This channel has a canvas containing important information [https://codeyourfuture.slack.com/canvas/C01332PNRTN](https://codeyourfuture.slack.com/canvas/C01332PNRTN). You **should read the canvas first**. This document contains additional information to help you find your way around as a volunteer.
