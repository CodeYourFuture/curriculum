**In ITD we want to cover the basics needed to start your journey in IT.**

Once you have joined our Slack channel and introduce yourself, you will follow a series of steps covering some basics:

1. How to use Slack and search engines
2. Data analysis and evaluation using Google Sheets
3. Learn HTML and CSS
4. Build a personal portfolio


👀 **Be aware** that during our bootcamp we are not teaching HTML and CSS. Most of it will be covered in the course we shared, but there is always more to learn. Be curious and expand your knowledge as much as you can
