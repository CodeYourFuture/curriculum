### Overview

Participants are required to score 100 or higher on the Duolingo English Practice Test, which corresponds to CEFR level B2. We set this level because we learned from the past that participants without it are unable to follow the course materials in the next courses.

**We want you to succeed.** If you have not yet reached this level, it is better to work on your English _first_ and then apply to us when you are _ready_.
