A volunteer will review your submission and check it meets the acceptance criteria.
Here is the criteria you need to meet:

```objectives
- You have taken the English placement test
- Your English level is B1 or higher
- You have shared a screenshot of your Duolingo test result
```

### B1

To join Introduction to Programming, the lowest level we can work with is B1. If you continue in our course, you will later on take another English test.

### B2

To join the Piscine, trainees need to be at level B2.

### C1

The goal is level C1 or higher

We set these levels because we have learned that people without this level of English proficiency cannot follow our courses. **We want you to succeed.** It is better to work on your English _first_ and then apply to us when you are _ready_.

Most people at Code Your Future speak English as a second language. All trainees will get lots of help and practise, but we do not have the expertise to teach English. Our expertise is in teaching programming languages.
