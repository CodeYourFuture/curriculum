A volunteer will review your submission and check that it meets the acceptance criteria. They will give you feedback on your submission and help you make any changes needed to meet the criteria.

Here are the criteria you need to meet:

```objectives
- You have taken the Duolingo Practice Test.
- Your score is 100 or higher, which is equivalent to level B2 or above.
- You have uploaded a screenshot of your Duolingo test result.
```


> [!NOTE]
> ##### B2
> To join Introduction to Programming (ITP), the lowest level we can work with is B2.
> ##### C1
> The goal is level C1 or higher
> 
> We set these levels because we have learned that people without this level of English proficiency cannot follow our courses. **We want you to succeed.** It is better to work on your English _first_ and then apply to us when you are _ready_.
>
> Most people at Code Your Future speak English as a second language. All trainees will get lots of help and practise, but we do not have the expertise to teach English. Our expertise is in teaching programming languages.
