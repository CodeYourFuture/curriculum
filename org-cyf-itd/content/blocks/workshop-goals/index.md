The aim of our workshop is to give "Intro to Digital" learner support whilst they study some basic technical and soft skills as well as sharing insights into the tech industry and inspiring students to continue with their self-study.

Applicants attending the session may be first timers or returners. They will have registered for the ITD course and should have seen and started working on the course material.

Our goal is to welcome, encourage, and support them in their learning journey. It is not to complete the work for them but to help them understand the work and how to complete it.

### The goal of this course is to:

```objectives
- Provide a tech foundation in the world of programming through the development of HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.
- Improve applicant’s self-learning skills as well as the ability to work and research problems online.
- Provide exposure to online tools and remote collaboration.
- Offer introduction to career opportunities within the tech industry.
- Offer education paths into programming and exposure to role models from disadvantaged backgrounds.
