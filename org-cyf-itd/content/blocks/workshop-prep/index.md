- [ ] Chosen a role ([step](../../steps)) to help with and communicated this to the lead volunteer
- [ ] Read over the [workshop agenda](./workshop-plan)
- [ ] Read over any additional material for your specific role
- [ ] Ask any questions in the #cyf-intro-to-digital-course channel on Slack

### Frequently Asked Questions from Students

During these sessions you'll receive lots of questions about all things CYF - Don't Panic! ... If you don't know the answer to a question you have a few options:

- Ask another volunteer or the lead volunteer for help

- Direct the learner to one of the following resources:

  1. FAQ at bottom of [study page](https://codeyourfuture.io/become-a-student/)

  2. FAQ on trainee [dashboard page](https://course1.codeyourfuture.io/dashboard)

- Direct everyone to ITD Slack as a great place to ask questions to the CYF community

If these don't solve the issue take down their name and contact details along with their question, pass it on to contact@codeyourfuture.io and let them know that we will follow up.
