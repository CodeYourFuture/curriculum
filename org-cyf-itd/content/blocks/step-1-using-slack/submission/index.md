### How to Submit Step 1

To complete this step, you only need to engage in Slack. Here's what to do:

---

#### ✅ What to Do

1. **Post a message** in the `#itd` Slack channel:
   - Say hello and share one thing you’ve learned in ITD so far

2. **React to at least 2 other students' messages** with emojis like:
   - ✅ for acknowledgment
   - ❤️ for appreciation
   - 🙌 for encouragement

3. *(Optional but encouraged)*: Reply to someone’s message in a thread

---

> Once you've done this, you're done with Step 1. No need to upload or send anything — your Slack activity is your submission!
