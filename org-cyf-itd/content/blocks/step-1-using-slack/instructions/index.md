## Part 1: Mastering Slack Communication

### Getting Started with Slack

Slack organizes conversations into *channels* and *direct messages (DMs)*. Think of it as having different rooms for different topics, plus private conversations.

### Channels vs Direct Messages

*Channels* (public or private) are for group discussions and team updates. *Direct Messages* are for private conversations between individuals or small groups.

### Seeing Who's in Channels

1. Click the channel name ‚Üí "View channel details" ‚Üí "Members" tab
2. Green dot (‚óè) shows who's currently active
3. Hover over usernames to see their status (Active, Away, Do Not Disturb), view their profile or send them a direct message

### Message Reactions and Threading

*Reactions* are quick responses using emojis (hover over message ‚Üí click emoji icon). Use ‚úÖ for acknowledgment (confirming you have seen the message), ‚ù§Ô∏è for appreciation, üôå for "Nice job."

*Threads* keep conversations organized. Click "Reply in thread" to respond without cluttering the main channel. Use threads for follow-up questions and detailed discussions. It is also an easy and organised way to manage multiple people wanting to respond to the same initial question.

*Key rule:* Always acknowledge direct questions, even with just an emoji reaction.

## Part 2: Mastering Search Engines

### Google Search for IT Professionals

Effective searching is crucial for troubleshooting and learning new technologies.

*Key techniques:*
- Use specific keywords: `"HTTP 500 error troubleshooting"` not `"website broken"`
- Exact phrases in quotes: `"cannot connect to database"`
- Exclude terms: `Python tutorial -snake`
- Site-specific: `site:stackoverflow.com JavaScript arrays`
- Recent results: Tools ‚Üí Past year

*Reliable sources:* Official documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub, MDN Web Docs

*Practice:* Try searching for "CSS Grid layout documentation" and "JavaScript const vs let difference"
