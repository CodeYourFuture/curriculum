{{/* We fall back through these opinions about time:

  1. set in the [[blocks]] array in the frontmatter of prep or day plan ??
  2. set in the front matter of a block ??
  3. set in any external api that is accessed ??
  4. default 60

  The point of setting time is to help trainees and volunteers understand
  how long to spend on activities.

  At the moment this is always a countdown timer web component.
  You can double click to set it going.
  TODO: make this opt in for a simple time block if that comes up.
