{{/* This uses graphQL instead of REST
  It returns a map of "blocks" so issues can be passed into the blocks loop instead of needing its own system
  If we decide we like this better, we should probably systematise this and store
  the graphql queries in their own dir
  https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#issue
  This exact matches on labels unlike the current system which partial matches inside Hugo
  We did that because PD kept making partially matching labels, but maybe we should be stricter
  TODO But it means someone has to go round and clean up
