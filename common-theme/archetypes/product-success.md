What is a good [learning objective](https://teachtogether.tech/en/#s:process-objectives)? How do we revise learning objectives to fit the CYF approach? There are two key methods:

1. Start with an [active verb](https://bloomstaxonomy.net/).
2. Make your objective testable.

In other words:

> Instead of a state of **being**, choose an act of **doing**.

It's common for people to begin writing learning objectives that are generally phrased like this:

"Be able to understand this concept."

### Let's revise this.

1. Start with the verb:

~~Be able to~~ understand this concept.

"**Understand** this concept."

2. Make it **testable**. How will the learner demonstrate this understanding?

"~~Understand~~ **Solve** three problems about this concept."

That's it.
