This is a placeholder file which will be replaced by hugo.

If this file doesn't exist, hugo will for some reason create a placeholder file with the wrong permissions, and won't be able to overwrite it with the rendered file.

You should never see this file served by a hugo site.

We wish we understood why hugo was creating a placeholder with permissions 0444 instead of 0644, but we can't work it out.

Oh, by the way, it only does so for some sites (specifically, common-docs, but not any others).
