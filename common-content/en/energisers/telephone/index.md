## ðŸ“ž Telephone Gameplay

Arrange participants in a line or circle. This game works best with 5 or more players and must be played in person.

The first player whispers a message to the next person. Each subsequent player whispers what they heard to the next person. The last player says the message out loud.

Compare the final message to the original to see how it changed.

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} minutes per round. Play a couple of rounds with different starting messages and message passers.
