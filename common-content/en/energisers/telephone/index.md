Arrange participants in a line or circle. This game works best with 5 or more players and must be played in person.

The first player whispers a message to the next person. Each subsequent player whispers what they heard to the next person. The last player says the message out loud.

Compare the final message to the original to see how it changed.

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} minutes per round. Play a couple of rounds with different starting messages and message passers.

Guide participants to reflect on communication challenges and strategies:

- What happened to the message as it traveled through the group?
- What techniques did you use to remember the message accurately?
- How does this game relate to real-world communication challenges?
- What strategies could improve message accuracy in this game?
- Can you think of a work scenario where a similar communication challenge might occur?

<details><summary>Evolve the game</summary>

Introduce variations to increase complexity and challenge:

- Round 2: Use a more complex message, such as a short riddle or technical instruction
- Round 3: Allow each player to ask one yes/no question to the person who whispered to them
- Round 4: Introduce background noise or distractions during message passing
- Round 5: Split into two teams and race to pass messages accurately, comparing final results
