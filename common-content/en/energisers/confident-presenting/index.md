# The Setup

Get everyone standing for this exercise!

1. Start by everyone demonstrating unconfident poses
2. Get everyone moving with a quick stretch or power pose to break the ice and release tension.

- Superman pose – feet shoulder-width apart, hands on hips, chest out.
- The victor - hands up in the air in a V and feet apart
- Any others?

3. In a power pose of your choosing go around the room and ask everyone to say their name in the most exaggerated, enthusiastic way possible, like they’re introducing themselves to a stadium of people.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is not proven science. This is just a fun game to get everyone up and moving around!
