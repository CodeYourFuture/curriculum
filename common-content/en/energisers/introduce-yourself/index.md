### Activity

In your professional life, you will often be asked to introduce yourself. It is a good idea to have an [elevator pitch](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf1041/files/media/elevator_pitch.pdf) ready, a brief (30 seconds) way of introducing yourself, getting across a key point or two, and making a connection with someone.

Today we will be going around the room and introducing ourselves!     `

Facilitator(s) start by sharing your elevator pitch and then popcorn around the room.

Some tips:
- Your response should be around 30 seconds.
- Have a list of items ready but tailor what you say to your audience. For example, at a technical conference focus on your technical interests rather than your love of making cupcakes, but on the first day of a new job introducing yourself to your new team feel free to add 1-2 personal details.
- Try to structure your response, 
    - Who are you? Where are you from? Where have you worked? Have you studied somewhere and what subjects?
    - What do you do? What are your skills, passions, or hobbies? What motivates you?
- Try to be enthusiastic, let your personality and confidence shine
- Allow space for follow-up questions
- It will feel awkward and nerve-wracking the first couple of times, practice-practice-practice to feel confident

#### Facilitator Check-in questions

- How did you feel about public speaking?
- What are some strategies to feel more confident when public speaking?
- What activities could you share to create a connection? Ex. Sports, Hobbies
