A creative way to practice Slack communication through collaborative storytelling.

1. **Facilitator**: Create a dedicated thread in your team's Slack channel.
2. Start with a simple prompt, eg:

- "Time travelers from 2030 visit to study our cohort as the pioneers of the tech industry. What made us so revolutionary?"
- "Scientists accidentally merged all our pets/favorite animals into one super-creature. Describe this majestic beast and its day at the office."
- "Breaking news: Our entire team just discovered we have superpowers! What powers did each person get and how did we first discover them?"

Now, each person will add **one sentence** to the story using:

1. üòÅ At least one emoji
1. One Slack formatting feature (**bold**, _italic_, bullet point)
1. One @mention of another team member, inviting them to continue the story.

Continue for {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}} minutes or until everyone has contributed.
