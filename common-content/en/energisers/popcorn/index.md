A quick introduction to popcorning where participants spontaneously "pop up" to share.

**Facilitator** grab something close to you and show it to the group. What is interesting about this object? What does it mean to you?

1. After sharing, say "popcorn to..." and choose someone else.
1. That person shares their response, then popcorns to another participant.

Continue until everyone has shared once or you run out of time.

> [!TIP]
> If everyone puts their hand up and then put it down after speaking, it's easier to see who hasn't shared yet.
