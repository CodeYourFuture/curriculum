#### Meet the time traveller

In this insight session, you will hear from an alumni who has been through the course and is now working in the tech industry. They will share their experience of training with MigraCode and how it has helped them in their career.

You will have the opportunity to ask questions and learn from their experience. If you could ask your future self anything about today, what would it be?

Put a call out on main Slack for alumni to volunteer to be a time traveller. They should be prepared to share their experience of the course and answer questions from the class.

Please do this a couple of weeks beforehand to give them time to prepare.
