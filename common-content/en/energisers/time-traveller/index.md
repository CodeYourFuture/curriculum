#### Meet the time traveller

In this motivational session, you will hear from an alumni who has been through the course and is now working in the tech industry. They will share their experience of training with {{<our-name>}} and how it has helped them in their career.

You will have the opportunity to ask questions and learn from their experience. If you could ask your future self anything about today, what would it be?
