## ðŸ‘‰ Zip Zap Boing Gameplay

In a single group, have participants stand in a circle. This game works best with 5 or more players and must be played in person.

### Make your zipzapper

Press your hands together in front of you, palms facing each other to make your energy zipzapper. Crackle! Feel the energy between your hands!

Point your zipzapper to the person next to you, and say "Zip".

Point your zipzapper at anyone in the circle and say "Zap".

Now, put both hands up in the air, jump, and say "Boing!" This reverses the direction of play.

## Play the game

One person starts by saying "Zip" and pointing to another person in the circle. That person then has three options:

1. _Zip_ the person on your left or right.
2. _Zap_ anyone in the circle.
3. _Boing_ the energy back to them, which reverses the direction of play.

The game continues with players reacting quickly to keep the energy flowing.

If someone hesitates or makes a mistake, they're out.

### Evolve the game

<details><summary>Add variations to increase complexity and challenge</summary>

- Round 2: Add a new word "Zop" which skips the next person in the circle
- Round 3: Players must use a different gesture for each word (e.g., point for Zip, thumbs up for Zap, jazz hands for Boing)
- Round 4: Increase the speed - anyone who takes more than 2 seconds to respond is out
