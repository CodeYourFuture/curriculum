{{<note type="In Person / Online">}}
If you're online, get into breakout rooms of up to 4 trainees. One person should open the [online Version of this game](https://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/online-traffic-jam-game.html) and share their screen.

If you're in person, get into groups of up to 4 trainees. If you have a [physical game](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/), use that, otherwise follow the online instructions.
{{</note>}}

One person should take on the role of **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!

**Each person must drive** so set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} and then swap.

You can do this energiser in person, online, or a mix of both. You can play this completely offline using this kit: [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/).

Start on **Level 6** or above and get everyone to load the page before you go into breakout rooms/groups.

<details><summary>Facilitator Check in questions</summary>

Model ways of thinking about the game strategically instead of just trying stuff randomly:

- Which car is the blocker? Everyone guess!
- What shall we do first?
- What do you notice about the cars? Are they different sizes?
- What do you notice about the board? What does this mean for our choices?
- Is it frustrating being the driver?
- Are we there yet? Shall we play another round?
- What one thing shall we say we noticed about this game, back in the main room?

### Evolve the game

Evolve the game each time you play to guide the players to insights

- Round 2: You must discuss for 1 minute before you make any moves
- Round 3: A single navigator can make no more than three moves in one go
- Round 4: Try to solve the puzzle in as few moves as you can
