## ðŸš— Traffic Jam Gameplay

In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!

**Each person must drive** so set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} and then swap.

You can do this energiser in person, online, or a mix of both. You can play this completely offline using this kit: [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/).

Start on **Level 6** or above and get everyone to load the page before you go into breakout rooms/groups. Put your [adblocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) on!

- What do you notice about the cars? Are they different sizes?
- What do you notice about the board? What does this mean for our choices?
- Is it frustrating being the driver?
- Are we there yet? Shall we play another round?
- What one thing shall we say we noticed about this game, back in the main room?
