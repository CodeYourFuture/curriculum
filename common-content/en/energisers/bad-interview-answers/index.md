### Setup

Grab a list of [common interview questions](https://www.coursera.org/articles/behavioral-interview-questions) from somewhere like Coursera.

### Game {{<timer>}}15{{</timer>}}

1. **Interviewer**: Cold call a random person and ask them an interview question. Choose an ordinary question.

2. **Interviewee**: You must give a terrible answer to this question (keep it clean, please!). Then cold call another person to be the interviewer.

3. **Interviewer**: Give absolutely straight-faced feedback. If you laugh, you’re out and must nominate another player to complete your feedback and return the game to step 1.
