### ⬜ ⬜ ⬛ ⬜

Let's count in binary using human beans!

Assign roles randomly. 1️⃣ One person will be the **caller**, 4️⃣ four people will be the **beans** and #️⃣ the rest will be the **counters**.

First four **beans**, line up facing away from the group. **Counters**, get in any kind of order so you know who is next.

The **caller** will say a number between 1 and 15.
For example, 8: 😀 ⬜ ⬜ ⬜

First **counter**, you will turn the beans around to represent the binary number. If you get it right, go back in the counter group and let the next person count. If you get it wrong, you must become another bean, and the range of numbers will increase!
