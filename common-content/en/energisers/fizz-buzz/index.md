## ðŸ”¢ Fizz Buzz Gameplay

Arrange participants in a circle (either in-person or virtually). The game can be played with any number of people, but 5 or more is ideal.

Starting with 1, players count upwards in turn. However:

- If a number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead of the number
- If a number is divisible by 5, say "Buzz" instead of the number
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say "Fizz Buzz"

For example: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16...

If a player makes a mistake, they're out. Continue counting until only one player remains.

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} minutes per round. If you have time, play multiple rounds.

### Evolve the game

<details><summary>Introduce variations to increase complexity and challenge</summary>

- Round 2: Add "Fuzz" for numbers divisible by 7
- Round 3: Replace "Fizz" with a clap, "Buzz" with a snap, and "Fizz Buzz" with a stomp
- Round 4: Count backwards from 100, applying the same rules
- Round 5: Allow players to create one new rule at the start of the round (e.g., "Bazz" for numbers ending in 2)
