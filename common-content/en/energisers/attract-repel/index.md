## ðŸ§² Attract Repel Gameplay

Participants stand in a circle or in a grid formation if online. This game works well with 8-20 players.

The facilitator calls out either "Attract" or "Repel". On "Attract", players take one step towards the center of the circle (or lean towards the camera if online). On "Repel", players take one step back (or lean away from the camera).

The trick is that players must do the opposite of what is called. So when the facilitator says "Attract", players should actually step back or lean away.

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}4{{</timer>}} minutes per round. Play multiple rounds, increasing speed or adding variations.

#### Facilitator Check in questions

<details><summary>Guide participants to reflect on their experience and learning</summary>

- How did you mentally process the instructions to do the opposite?
- Did you find yourself improving over time? How?
- What strategies did you use to stay focused?
- How does this exercise relate to challenging assumptions in problem-solving?
- Did you notice any patterns in your own or others' mistakes?
- How did the speed of the game affect your performance?
- In what work scenarios might this kind of quick, contrarian thinking be useful?

### Evolve the game

<details><summary>Introduce variations to increase complexity and challenge</summary>

- Round 2: Add "Neutral" command where players should not move
- Round 3: Pair players up. They must move in opposite directions to each other
- Round 4: Introduce hand movements along with stepping (e.g., hands up for Attract, hands down for Repel)
- Round 5: Reverse the rules halfway through the round without warning
