## 🧲 Attract Repel Chaos Gameplay

This game is best played in-person with 8 or more participants in an open space.

1. Clear a space in the room for participants to move freely.
2. Ask everyone to start walking around the room.
3. Instruct each person to silently choose two colleagues: one to stay close to (attract) and one to stay far from (repel).
4. On your signal, participants begin trying to stay as close as possible to their 'attract' person while staying as far as possible from their 'repel' person.

That's it. Chaos will ensue! Enjoy!
