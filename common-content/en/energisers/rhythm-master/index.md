## 🎵 Rhythm Master Gameplay

Arrange participants in a circle, either in-person or virtually. This game works best with a larger group.

One person starts as the "Rhythm Master" and creates a simple rhythmic pattern using body percussion (claps, snaps, pats, stomps). The group must replicate this rhythm together.

The Rhythm Master can change the pattern at any time, and the group must adapt quickly. Meanwhile, one player (the "Beat Detective") who has stepped out or muted their audio/video, tries to identify who the Rhythm Master is upon returning.

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}3{{</timer>}} minutes per round. Play multiple rounds with different Rhythm Masters and Detectives.
