We're all getting to know each other for the first time. No one knows anyone yet - let's fix that!

Form a circle, and take turns going around the circle to introduce yourself. Say your name, and what your favourite dessert is.

When everyone has taken their turn, try to agree as a group what the whole class's favourite dessert was.
