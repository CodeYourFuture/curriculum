# 👣 To Do

<details>
<summary>

### 🎙️ The Facilitator will:

</summary>

1. Assemble the entire group (all volunteers & all students) in a circle
1. Briefly welcome everyone with an announcement, like this:
   > 💬 "Morning everyone, Welcome to another Saturday at MigraCode, this week we are working on Module X Sprint 3 and we're currently working on {summarise what the topic of the week is}"
1. Now check: is it the _start of a new module_? Is it sprint 1? If so, read out [the success criteria for the new module](../../../success).
1. Next add one thing you hope to find out or learn about today.
