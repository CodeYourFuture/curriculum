1. Assemble the entire group (all volunteers & all trainees) in a circle
1. Briefly welcome everyone with an announcement, like this:
   > üí¨ "Morning everyone, Welcome to {{<our-name>}} {REGION}, this week we are working on {MODULE} {SPRINT} and we're currently working on {SUMMARISE THE TOPICS OF THE WEEK}"
1. Ask any newcomers to introduce themselves to the group, and welcome them.
1. Now check: is it the _start of a new module_? Is it sprint 1? If so, read out the success criteria for the new module.
1. Next go through the _morning day plan only_ (typically on the curriculum website) - and check the following things:
