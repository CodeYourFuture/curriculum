{{<note title="Retro (20 minutes)" type="activity">}}
A retro is a chance to reflect. You can do this on [RetroTool](https://retrotool.io/) (create a free anonymous retro and share the link with the class) or on sticky notes on a wall.

1. Set a [timer for 5 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+5+minutes). There's one on the RetroTool too.
1. Write down as many things as you can think of that you'd like to _start_, _stop_, and _continue_ doing next sprint.
1. Write one point per note and keep it short.
1. When the timer goes off, one person should set a [timer for 1 minute](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+1+minute) and group the notes into themes.
1. Next, set a [timer for 2 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+2+minutes) and all vote on the most important themes by adding a dot or a +1 to the note.
1. Finally, set a [timer for 8 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+8+minutes) and all discuss the top three themes.
