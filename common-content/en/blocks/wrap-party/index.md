You made it! 🎉

Thank you so much for your hard work. You've learned a lot and built some amazing things.

Whether you're continuing with another course at {{<our-name>}} or moving on to employment, we're proud of you. 🌟

Now, join the wrap party and celebrate your achievements with your community. 🎈

Can you bring a snack or drink to share? 🍪🥤 Or a board game? We love Dixit, Codenames, and Rush Hour in particular.
