Every session begins with an energiser. Usually there's a rota showing who will lead the energiser. We have some favourite games you can play if you are stuck.

1. [Traffic Jam](https://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/online-traffic-jam-game.html): re-order the cars to unblock yourself
2. [Telephone](https://garticphone.com/): draw the words and write the pictures
3. Popcorn show and tell: popcorn around the room and show one nearby object or something in your pocket or bag and explain what it means to you.
