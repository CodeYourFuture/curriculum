## What are we doing now?

You're going to use this prep time to answer some questions _and schedule in times to review your understanding_. In your planner or calendar, schedule a short (10 minute) review of your answers:

{{<note type="tip" title="Space at increasing intervals">}}

- One week from today
- One month from today
- Three months from today
- Six months from today
- One year from today

{{</note>}}

Do this now. Then move forward to working through as many of these questions as you can. (You may not complete them all, and that is ok.)

_Write down your answers first_ and then update them after looking at the sample answers, if it's useful to do so. Use all available tools to help you answer, and remember:

> the point _is not_ to complete the exercises
> the point is for you to secure your own understanding

### Examples of tools you might use

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
- [A large language model like ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
