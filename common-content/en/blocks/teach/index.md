This sprint you should have prepared to teach one of the concepts explored in your prep and backlog. 

## ⏰ Timekeeper

The timekeeper will keep the groups on track. Keep it energetic and give people about a minute to change over before they start teaching again. 

## 📚 Instructions

Split into pairs. Each person will have 3 minutes to present their topic. After the lesson, you and your student will discuss the topic for 3 minutes. Then the student will become the teacher and present their own topic.

## 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏻 Pairs

### 1. Model

You will explain your topic to your student. You will have 3 minutes to communicate, in whatever way you have prepared. You can use a drawing, a game, a conversation, or anything you like that will help you communicate the concept, except a computer!

### 2. Check understanding

After your lesson, you and your student check your understanding for another 3 minutes. Then you will switch roles.

### 3. Add yourself to another group

At the end of both lessons, join another pair. Pick one of your topics and explain it to the other pair together. They will do the same for you. At the end of both lessons, join another group of four and repeat the process.

## 💡 Tips:

- **Practice** your lesson before class.
- **Keep it simple**. Just choose one concept to explain.
- **Keep it short**. Three minutes is enough.
