1. 🎙️ Nominate a **facilitator** (trainee or volunteer)
2. ⏰ Nominate a **timekeeper** (trainee or volunteer)

## 🎙️ Facilitator

Your role is make sure that everybody gets the chance to speak. Start the discussion by asking the group:

- What are the key ideas in this sprint that you want to discuss?
- What's the biggest blocker you have right now?

Invite the group to spend ⏰ 5 minutes writing down key ideas and blockers on a board.

{{<note type="tip" title="Use what works for your team">}}
You can use an actual whiteboard, Slack thread, GitHub board, [Miro](https://miro.com/), whatever works for your group. You might already have a board you're adding to in the week.

## Vote on the focus

Give the group ⏰ 2 minutes to vote on what to discuss. +1 on the question is fine.

## 🐇 Begin with the most popular topic

Give the group ⏰ 10 minutes to discuss the most popular topic. Move the discussion on if it gets stuck. If the group is struggling to come up with ideas, ask them to think about:

- What documentation relates to this topic?
- What other problem is this problem like, that you have met before?
- Is there another way to solve this problem?

## 🕳️ Move on to the next topic

Keep the discussion moving and help the group to stay on track. Your job is to prevent "rabbit holing" on one topic.

## ⏰ Timekeeper

Keep the discussion on track by keeping an eye on the time. Use a stopwatch and give the group a 30 second warning before the end of the session.
