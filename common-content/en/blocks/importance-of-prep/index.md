In a flipped learning model, learners are expected to **prepare** before they meet up as a community.
Therefore, regular preparation is essential for our community to self-learn together. In each sprint week of a particular module, trainees will be expected to work on the prep section of the curriculum to start building their understanding of a particular topic.

Check out the prep for JS1 to gain an example of what trainees will be expected to engage with before an in-person session: https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js1/sprints/1/prep/
