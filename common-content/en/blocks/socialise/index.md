At {{<our-name>}} we learn as a community. You're going to be spending the coming months with the people around you. After that, they will form part of your professional network too.

We encourage you to spend time getting to know them! This is optional. But after class, we encourage you to do something like:
* Hang around in the class space chatting or playing games.
* Go sit in a nearby park together.
* Go to a local cafe for hot drinks.
* Go to a nearby pub.
* Or any other ideas you have!

Make sure everyone who wants to join in will feel welcome wherever you go (e.g. a lot of people don't like drinking or being near alcohol).

If {{<our-name>}} is paying childcare expenses so that you can come to class, we're happy to pay for this time as well.
