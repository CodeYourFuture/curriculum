This next exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository.
We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission -  to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended ‚Äî you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please **do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository**.
