The goal of a kata is to practice a specific skill, such as refactoring, or to learn a new language or framework.

Kata are often used in [coding dojo](https://codingdojo.org/practices/WhatIsCodingDojo/), a practice where a group of programmers work together to solve a programming problem. Today we will use kata to practice TDD, using a simple kata from our [Codewars collections](https://www.codewars.com/users/CodeYourFuture/authored_collections).

One person will be the **driver**. The driver can only write the code as directed by the navigator.
One person will be the **navigator**. The navigator can only give directions to the driver. Hands off the keyboard!

The driver and navigator will solve the kata TDD style. First write a failing test, then write the code to make it pass. Then refactor the code. Write the simplest code that passes the test. Start with the simplest test, and work your way up to the most complex.
