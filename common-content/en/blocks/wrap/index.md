You are done for the day. Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned and achieved.

Stand in a circle and share:

- 📛 your name
- 💪🏽 one thing you achieved today
- 👷🏾 the task you are going to work on next
- 🛟 one thing you need help with

Give yourselves a round of applause. Now you have earned your rest. Usually people go for a cup of tea or a pint after class. You are welcome to join and wind down together.
