Communication is _hard_. Today, let’s explore some ways we communicate with each other in software development. It’s not enough to draw a picture of a website and assume the other person will build what you imagine. It’s never a good idea to assume shared context or shared interpretations.

So how do we understand what to do? By understanding **requirements**.

### Formalising Requirements

Today we're going to think about requirements. We're going to ask these questions:

- _why_ we're working on a project
- _who_ we're making it for
- _what_ they're going to use it for.

Before starting to solve a problem (how), step back and ask yourself those **why**, **who**, and **what** questions.

We're going to think about a few projects and discover some requirements. This is really important in order to do technical work, but you don't need to have any coding experience, or be thinking about coding, when doing this.
