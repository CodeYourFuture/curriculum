Welcome, everyone. This workshop is your first set of technical "glasses". You're going to learn to see a website like a developer. This means you will use a system of inquiry to help you find information in complex interfaces.

_Caution: Once you start seeing like a developer, you can't unsee it! You might find it harder to view interfaces as a regular user would - which is ironically who we design them for._

## Requirements

This workshop is designed to be completed on GitHub. You will need to have a GitHub account and access to the internet. Other than that it's for newbies!

Before you start, make sure you can access [the repository we will use for this exercise](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/github_issues_prs_practice).

There are three activities. Split into groups of no more than 5 and set a timer so you don't lose track of time. 


{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 1: Eat Me, Drink Me (10 minutes)">}}

The first thing you should always do is find and read the README

- Find the README file in this repository
- What's the purpose of a README file?
- What's the purpose of the repository?

Key takeaway: don't skip over text. Read it.

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 2: You've Got Issues (20 minutes)">}}

All your coursework is assigned as issues, so you definitely need to understand them. 

- Can you find where issues are listed?
- Look at the labels - what story do they tell about how work is organized? Hover over them - what else can you find out?
- Create an issue yourself. What options do you discover? You can look at [the deployed site](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/github_issues_prs_practice/) and the `requirements.md` file in the repository to help you identify what's wrong with the page.
- Challenge: Can you find out who decides what labels mean?

Popcorn round your group and share one key takeaway

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 3: Pull Requests (20 minutes)">}}

Time to explore how code changes are tracked and discussed. You're going to need to slow way way down here. Instead of jumping around, skipping over all the details, you're going to read this page view from top to bottom. Really look at it. Ask each other: what does this button mean? Where does this link go? 

- Where can you see all the pull requests on this repo?
- Find a pull request (PR) and "step through" the interface reading it line by line.
- What's the story being told in the PR?
- Can you piece together what changed and why?
- Where can you find the file changes in this PR?
- How can you filter the changes in the file view?
- Where is the conversation happening?

Write your key takeaway down in your notebook.

{{<note type="exercise" title="Solo Challenge: Hidden Powers (5 minutes)">}}

Take 5 minutes to click around and try things:

- What happens when you press '/' or 't'?
- Can you find other keyboard shortcuts?
- What search tools can you discover?
- How could you find a word on this page instantly?

Share your most surprising discovery with the group as you wrap up

Remember: There's no "correct" path through this workshop. The goal is to develop your own way of exploring and understanding interfaces.
