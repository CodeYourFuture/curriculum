### 📂 Create a working directory for the module

1. Fork the coursework module (always linked in every backlog) and open it in VSCode.
1. In your VSCode terminal, navigate to the root of your project directory.
1. Create a new directory called `prep` to store all the files you'll be working on for this module.

As you work through the module, you'll be creating files in this directory to code along with the prep content. You are expected to code along with the prep content.

For simple one liners, use the terminal REPL to run the code. For more complex problems, create files in the `prep` directory and write the code there. Make commented notes as you go along explaining why you're doing what you're doing. Your future self will thank you.

### 🔑 The most important thing is to secure your understanding

The prep content is designed to help you understand the concepts you'll be working with in the module. Don't just read it, code along with it. Also take notes, draw diagrams, pose your own questions and try to answer them.

To really understand programming, you need to write the code yourself, and do the exercises. You must [take active part](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111) in your learning to succeed.
