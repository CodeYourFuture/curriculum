#### Come on time when you're learning

Many people give up their free time to teach us. They could be doing other things. We should respect this and always be on time.

#### Clean up after ourselves

Kind people let us use their space. We should keep it tidy and clean, just like our own homes.

#### Talk to each other (in English)

Put Slack on your phone and computer. Use it to ask for help and talk about classes.
Speaking English helps everyone get better at it. Even if you know someone's language, try to use English.

#### Learn to find answers yourself

We teach you how to look things up. Try to use Google to answer your own questions.

#### Use the computer yourself

Don't let volunteers or peers type for you. Ask for help, but do the work yourself.

#### Help each other out

You're all learning together. You can understand each other's problems. Ask for help and offer it too. Explaining things to others helps you learn more.

#### We're all part of this

This isn't just a coding school. It's for all of us - participants, students, volunteers. Try to make it better in any way you can.
