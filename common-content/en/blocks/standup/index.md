It's time to [stand up](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups). Split into groups of no more than 6 people.

Stand in a circle and share for no more than 60 seconds each:

- 📛 your name
- 💪🏽 What you worked on yesterday
- 🛟 What issues are blocking you / What problems you encountered
- 👷🏾 What you will work on today

After everyone has given an update, reflect on next steps together. Can you team up on shared blockers? Is someone working on something interesting that you want to know more about?
