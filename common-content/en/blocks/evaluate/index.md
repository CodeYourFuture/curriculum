You must check in with yourself and evaluate your progress as you move through the course.

Check your progress against your past self: go back to and tackle a problem from a previous part of the course.

{{<note title="Pair up and check progress" type="activity">}}

## Setup 🧰

1. Trainees need to split up into pairs
1. In your pairs, nominate a driver and a navigator. A driver will type out the code. A navigator will use the prep to steer you in your solution.

## Activity

1. Find a problem from 2 modules ago and familiarise yourself with it
1. Test and implement a solution to the chosen problem

### Pay attention ❗🔍

- Write tests first and run your tests frequently to get feedback
- Swap driver and navigator roles often - perhaps after every test
- Use your unit tests to break down the problem - don't try implementing everything all at once
- Discuss your strategy together before writing any code
- Check the learning objectives in each block. Do they make sense? Discuss them together as a pair
