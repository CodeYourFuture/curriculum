To play Telephone without the internet, you will need: pens, paper, a stopwatch or timer

- In groups of no more than 6, give each person a pen and a sheet of paper. You might want to pre-fold the paper into thirds or sixths so people know how big to draw
- Alternating around the group, choose Red/Yellow/Red/Yellow/Red/Yellow
- **Faciliator**: Shout _telephone!_ and set a timer for 30 seconds (a tomato timer is good for this)
- All the **Reds**: draw a picture
- All the **Yellows**: write a sentence
- When the timer rings, fold the paper over and pass it left
- **Faciliator**: Shout _telephone!_ and set a timer for 30 seconds: it's 30 seconds a round.
- **Players**: Look at your new picture or sentence. Do your best to draw the sentence or write the picture.
- When the timer rings, fold the paper over and pass it left
- Continue until your starting paper returns to you
