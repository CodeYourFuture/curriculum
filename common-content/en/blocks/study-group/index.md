## What are we doing now?

You're going to use this time to work through coursework. Your cohort will collectively self-organise to work through the coursework together in your own way. Sort yourselves into groups that work for you.

## Use this time wisely

You will have study time in almost every class day. Don't waste it. Use it to:

- work through the coursework
- ask questions and get unblocked
- give and receive code review
- work on your portfolio
- develop your own projects
