## Trainees

This is time for you to get help with whatever you need help with.

If you didn't understand something in the prep, ask about it.

If you were struggling with a backlog exercise, get help with it.

If you weren't quite sure of something in a workshop, discuss it.

If you don't have any problems, keep working through the backlog until you need help.

It can be useful to get into groups with others facing the same problem, or working on the same backlog item.

## Volunteers

Don't be scared to approach people and ask what they're working on - see if you can help them out, or stretch their understanding.

If lots of people have the same problems, maybe you can put together a demonstration or a workshop to help them understand.

If absolutely no one needs help, consider [reviewing some PRs](/prs-needing-review) using the process and guidelines in [the #cyf-code-review-team Slack channel](https://codeyourfuture.slack.com/archives/C07RZA0ERLN) canvas.

## Breaks

No one can work solidly forever! Make sure to take breaks when you need.
