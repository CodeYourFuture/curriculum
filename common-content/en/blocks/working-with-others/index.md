We're all here to learn and grow. Our goals are to become self-sufficient - able to do our own work, and get help when we need it.

We're part of a **community**. We help each other, but we're also each trying to learn for ourselves.

Below are a number of scenarios. Have a group discussion about each scenario. What do you think is good and bad about how people are working? What should they do differently? Why?

Spend {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} on each scenario.

### 1. Working together in a group on a piece of coursework

Amira, Babak, and Charlie are on a call together talking through how to approach a problem.

They each write their own code on their own laptops, but Babak doesn't think he could solve it on his own. If he deleted his code, and tried to solve it again after the call, he isn't confident he would be successful. But he's really eager to complete the sprint and move on to the next topic.

* Understanding is more important than speed.
* Deleting and re-trying exercises is a good test of understanding.
* Working together is good, but everyone needs to leave with understanding.

### 2. Watching someone solve Codewars exercises

Amira, Babak, and Charlie have a call every week where they watch Charlie solve Codewars exercises.

This is good practice for Charlie. And Amira and Babak find it useful to see how Charlie solves the problems.

* Working together is good.
* Seeing how other people solve problems can be interesting.
* Taking turns is better than always being in the same roles.
* Everyone can learn from each other.

### 3. Asking ChatGPT to solve a problem and copy+pasting the answer

Dara is trying to do a piece of coursework, but isn't sure what code to write. They ask ChatGPT to solve the problem, and copy+paste the solution into a pull request.

Dara is pretty sure they understand the code, but isn't sure they could write it again from scratch if they needed to.

<details>

<summary>Facilitation hints</summary>

* Deleting and re-trying exercises is a good test of understanding.
* Submitting copy+pasted code is a waste of volunteer time - people spend time reviewing it.
* No one will hire you just to copy+paste from ChatGPT. You need understanding.
* The point of coursework isn't for you to complete it, it's for you to learn by doing it, even if that's a struggle and takes time.
