 At MigraCode, there will be scheduled community lunches throughout the year during which all of MigraCode team will joing and would like to invite you to eat with us. The MC team will let you know when the upcoming community lunch will be. Bring your home-cooked food or buy some food across the street at Glories (e.g., at the Carrefour Supermarket or pick up some to-go meal from one of the restaurants there). We share our time, food and our stories. We learn about each other and the world. We build community.üë≠üë¨

On days where there is no community lunch planned you can still stay to socialise here and use the terrace to meet you peers and connect (this goes especially for class days that are longer than just until 2pm.)

Adevinta allows us to use their beautiful space, cutlery, plates, microwaves etc - please make sure to leave everything exactly as it was before so they keep lending their precious space to us ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Ah and make sure to check out the foosball table on the terrace.
