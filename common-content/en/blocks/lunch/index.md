Every Saturday we eat together on the 9th floor. Bring your home-cooked food or buy some food across the street at Glories (e.g., at the Carrefour Supermarket or pick up some to-go Food from one of the restaurants there). We share our time, food and our stories. We learn about each other and the world. We build community.

Adevinta allows us to use their beautiful space, cutlery, plates, micrwaves etc - please make sure to leave everything exactly as it was before so they keep lending their precious space to us ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Ah and make sure to check out the foosball table on the terrace.
