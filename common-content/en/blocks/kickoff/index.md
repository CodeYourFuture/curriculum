At {{<our-name>}} we work in small teams to deliver working software with tests.

{{<note type="tip">}}
It's important that software works and the people can use it

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

You will be split randomly into groups of 3-4. You will join the team to which you are assigned without making a fuss about it, thanks! :wink:

## ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- **Review** the project docs before kickoff.
- **Keep it simple**. Identify the simplest way you can meet the criteria.
- **Break it down**. Split the work into small tasks on a board.
- **Communicate**. Make sure everyone knows what they are doing.
- **Set deadlines**. Agree on when you will have each task done.
