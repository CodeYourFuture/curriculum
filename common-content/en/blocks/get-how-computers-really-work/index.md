Throughout this course, we will reference the book [How Computers Really Work](https://www.howcomputersreallywork.com/) by Matthew Justice.

You will need a copy. {{<our-name>}} is working out how to get you a copy if you can't afford one.

If you buy your own copy [from e.g. Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Computers-Work-Hands-Workings/dp/1718500661), {{<our-name>}} cannot pay for this.
