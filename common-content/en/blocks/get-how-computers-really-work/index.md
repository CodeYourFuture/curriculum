Throughout this course, we will reference the book [How Computers Really Work](https://www.howcomputersreallywork.com/) by Matthew Justice.

You will need a copy. {{<our-name>}} is working out how to distribute copies, but you can buy your own e.g. [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Computers-Work-Hands-Workings/dp/1718500661). {{<our-name>}} cannot currently reimburse you for this if you choose to buy your own copy.
