#### Imagine a coursework tracker

As trainees, you have coursework to do. Imagine a website which tracks how coursework is going for you all. Thinking about that website, some user stories could be:

- As a trainee, I can ask for help with a topic or task.
- As a mentor, I can see who needs extra support.
- As a trainee, I can see what coursework I need to complete and when.
- As a mentor, I can see what coursework has not been completed.

These each take the form "As [who], I can [what]". They don't say why yet.

{{<note type="activity" title="Exercise 10 Minutes" >}}
In groups of about 5.

Talk about why the "who" is useful. What would we be missing if we didn't think about the "Who"?

Now think about the "why" for each of the listed user stories. Why are they important?

> As a [who], I can [what] so that **[why]**

{{<note type="activity" title="Exercise 10 Minutes" >}}

Write some user stories for our coursework tracker on a Jamboard.

Think about the "who", "what", and "why" for each.

You can think of new "who"s (e.g. the people who write the coursework questions), and as many "what"s as you want - but make sure you remember the "why".

Why is thinking about user stories useful?

What's useful about thinking about the "who" and the "why"? What could go wrong if you don't think about them?
