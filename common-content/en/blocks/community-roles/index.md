**Your local CodeYourFuture community is run by the trainees and volunteers**, who are together every Saturday. There are some tasks that must be done _weekly_, to ensure it all runs smoothly. Let's decide who's can help with what?

The below list of coordinator roles are responsible for finding people weekly to do the tasks.
The person on this role should NOT be the ones who that tasks every week.
We suggest changing the coordinator every month, but you can decide what works best.
If the coordinator is no longer able to do this role, please identify someone else who can do it. 

Steps:
1. Read these roles and define the coordinators
    - **Lunch Coordinator**: choose someone for every week who will 
        - make the list of food that is needed, checking leftovers (if applicable)
        - knowing the community's dietary requirements
        - choosing who will buy OR communicating with who will buy
        - choosing who will help on the day (setting up/clearing out)
    - **Energiser Coordinator**: choosing who will do the energiser in the following week, ensuring it is done every week
    - **Timekeep Coordinato**r**: choosing who will time keep, ensure it happens so the class stays on track
2. Share the coordinator names on your local Community Slack so everyone knows who they are
3. Coordinator: identify volunteers for the next 1-2 weeks
4. Repeat this whenever needed

The coordinator roles and individual weekly roles are important ways to build a community based on trust and autonomy. But also helps each of you to practice some important **communication, planning and leadership skills**, which you will need for your future jobs in tech.
