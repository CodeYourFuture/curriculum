===[[Gameplay]]===

{{<note type="activity" title="Activity 25 minutes">}}

In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!

**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for [**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) and then swap.

===[[Facilitation Tips]]===

You can do this workshop in person, online, or a mix of both. You can run this workshop completely offline using this kit: [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/).

Start on **Level 6** or above and get everyone to load the page before you go into breakout rooms/groups.

#### Facilitator Check in questions

<details><summary>Model ways of thinking about the game strategically instead of just trying stuff randomly</summary>

- Which car is the blocker? Everyone guess!
- What shall we do first?
- What do you notice about the cars? Are they different sizes?
- What do you notice about the board? What does this mean for our choices?
- Is it frustrating being the driver?
- Are we there yet? Shall we play another round?
- What one thing shall we say we noticed about this game, back in the main room?

</details>

### Evolve the game

<details><summary>Evolve the game each time you play to guide the players to insights</summary>

- Round 2: You must discuss for 1 minute before you make any moves
- Round 3: A single navigator can make no more than three moves in one go
- Round 4: Try to solve the puzzle in as few moves as you can

</details>

{{<note type="discussion" title="Example reflection">}}
This game interests me because to be successful you have to identify the blockers, which is something we all need to get better at. In this game, the blocker is often not the immediately obvious car ‘in the way’. To find it you might have to trace backwards around the board, thinking: to move this one I need to move that one, to move that one, I need to move this next one… And then you need to explain that to your team!

It’s a good reflection on blockers and planning.
