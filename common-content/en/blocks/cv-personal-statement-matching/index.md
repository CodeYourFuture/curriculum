Personal statements should be personal. [They're not generic statements, they're about _you_](/guides/employability/cvs/common-mistakes/#generic-personal-statements).

We're going to play a game to test this.

<!-- TODO: Link to a "match the CVs" game when one exists: https://projects.codeyourfuture.io/briefings/#cv-matching-game -->

### Set-up (5 minutes)

All trainees should send a copy of their CV personal statement to one volunteer. That volunteer should make a slideshow where each slide shows one personal statement, without a name. It should just show the personal statement, not the whole CV.

### Playing the game (15 minutes)

Go through as a class one slide at a time. The class should vote on who each statement belongs to. Don't reveal who was correct until the end of the game.

### Discussion (10 minutes)

Ideally when you read someone's personal statement, it should be personal enough that you know whose it is.

How often was this the case for your class?

What made the personal statements personal? What was generic and hard to identify?

How can you make your personal statement more personal?
