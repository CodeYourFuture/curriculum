We learn from other people's journeys, so let's talk to an Intro to Programming graduate about how their journey was.

Actively listen to what they are telling you and ask your own questions. Below are some ideas if you are unsure what to ask.

- Is the course really difficult?
- What did you have to give up when doing this course?
- What was the hardest bit of it?
- What was the best experience you had during Intro to Programming?
- Who helped you most during Intro to Programming?

If you want to hear from more graduates, ask your volunteers to engage some more. Different people experience things differently.
