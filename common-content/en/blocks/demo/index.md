At CYF we expect you to demo your work to the class. You must have many opportunities to practice how to clearly and simply **explain your work to others**. This is really important both for interviews and for getting promoted later on.

## ‚è∞ Timekeeper

The timekeeper will keep the groups on track.

Split into groups of no more than 5 people. Each person will have 2 minutes to demo their work to the group. After the demo, the group will give feedback for 10 minutes. Then the next person will demo their work.

### 1. Demo

You will demo your work to the group. You will have 2 minutes to explain what you did and why. It's ok to show broken code or code that doesn't work yet. Just make sure your demo is interesting.

### 2. Feedback

After the demo, the group will give you feedback for up to 10 minutes. It's smart to suggest what kind of feedback you want by asking some "generative" questions. For example:

- I wasn't sure if it makes sense to try X. What do you think?
- I liked the way I did X, but I know there are other approaches, what did you do?
- I found X really confusing, did anyone else have the same problem?

## üí° Tips:

- **Practice** your demo before class.
- **Keep it simple**. Don't try to show everything you did. Just show _one_ interesting thing.
- **Keep it short**. Two minutes is enough.
- **Explain** what you did and why.
- **Show** your code.
- **Ask** for feedback.
