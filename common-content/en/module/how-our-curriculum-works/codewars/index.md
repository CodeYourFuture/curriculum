[Codewars](https://docs.codewars.com/) is an online code challenge platform that allows users to hone their skills on thousands of [katas](https://docs.codewars.com/concepts/kata). The platform is useful for developing problem-solving skills and improving your fluency in a programming language. Another key advantage is _immediate feedback_. Users can check their programming solutions with pre-built test suites, gaining very quick feedback on their progress.
