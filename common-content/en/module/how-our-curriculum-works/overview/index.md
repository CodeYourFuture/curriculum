The course is divided into modules, each with a theme and learning objectives. Modules are divided into week-long sprints. Each sprint contains these activities in this order:

##### 1. Start with the: **🧑🏾‍💻 Prep**, which explains the main concepts of the sprint.

**Learners** complete prep before class. **Mentors** browse prep to know what learners are learning.

##### 2. Then go to: **🏷️ Backlog**, a list of coursework assignments as issues.

**Learners** clone issues to project boards and work on them. **Mentors** browse issues to know what learners are doing.

##### 3. For class it's the: **🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾 Day Plan**, a timestamped agenda for class day.

Usually a lively morning workshop and quieter afternoon study-group. **Everyone** should review the plan to prepare for class.

##### 4. Review with: **✅ Success**, the learning objectives for the sprint.

**Learners** check off goals. **Mentors** help us focus on the sprint goals.
