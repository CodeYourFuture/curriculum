Courses are divided into modules, each with a theme. Modules are divided into week-long sprints made up of:

##### 1. **🧑🏾‍💻 Prep** - the main concepts of the sprint

**Learners** complete prep before class.  
**Mentors** browse prep to know what learners are learning.

##### 2. **🏷️ Backlog** - coursework assignments

**Learners** clone issues to project boards and work on them.  
**Mentors** browse issues to know what the learners are doing.

##### 3. **🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾 Day Plan** - timestamped agenda for class

Usually a lively morning workshop and quieter afternoon study-group.  
**Everyone** should review the plan to prepare for class.

##### 4. **✅ Success** - Learning objectives for the sprint

**Learners** check off goals.  
**Mentors** help us focus on the sprint goals.
