The course is divided into modules, each with a theme and learning objectives. Modules are divided into week-long sprints. Each sprint contains these activities in this order:

##### 1. Start with the: **🧑🏾‍💻 Prep**, which explains the main concepts of the sprint.

MC students complete prep before the Thursday class. Volunteers browse prep to know what learners are learning.

##### 2. Then go to: **🏷️ Backlog**, a list of coursework assignments as issues.

MC students clone issues to project boards and work on them. Volunteers browse issues to know what learners are doing. Before Thursday evening your are expected to have finished at least the "Prep" of the given week. On Thursday`s we have an online class in which students can ask questions and disolve blockers. A volunteer will be there to solve doubts.

##### 3. For Saturday class it's the: **🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾 Day Plan**.

It is usually a lively morning workshop that goes until 14:00, in more difficult weeks the day might be longer. Saturday class takes place in person and everyone is expected to come. Everyone should review the plan to prepare for class.



##### 4. Review with: **✅ Success**, the learning objectives for the sprint.

**MC students** check off goals and reflect if they learnt the important concepts.
