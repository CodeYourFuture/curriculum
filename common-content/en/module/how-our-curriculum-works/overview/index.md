Courses are divided into modules, each with a theme. Modules are divided into week-long sprints.

Each sprint contains the following activities:

##### 1. Start with the: **🧑🏾‍💻 Prep**

_Explains the main concepts of the sprint._

**Learners** complete prep before class.  
**Mentors** browse prep to know what learners are learning.

##### 2. Then go to: **🏷️ Backlog**

_Lists coursework assignments as issues_.

**Learners** clone issues to project boards and work on them.  
**Mentors** browse issues to know what the learners are doing.

##### 3. For class it's the: **🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾 Day Plan**

_Timestamped agenda for class day._

Usually a lively morning workshop and quieter afternoon study-group.

**Everyone** should review the plan to prepare for class.

##### 4. Review with: **✅ Success**

_Lists learning objectives for the sprint._

**Learners** check off goals.  
**Mentors** help us focus on the sprint goals.
