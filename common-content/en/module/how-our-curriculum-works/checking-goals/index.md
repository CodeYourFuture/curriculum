Learning something as a complete beginner can be daunting: it is often difficult to know where to start. To learn effectively, we must set clear and measurable learning objectives to direct our education. Objectives should allow us to answer questions like this:

- Which concepts are we trying to understand?

- What skills should I have after my course of study?

- What evidence do I need to demonstrate my understanding?

With clear objectives in mind, we can continually evaluate our progress by checking against these objectives. During the course, you must evaluate your progress against a **sprint‚Äôs success page**. For each sprint, the success view lists all the learning objectives for any prep and workshops. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a sprint. Use this view to evaluate your progress.

A module also has a success page, listing the overall learning objectives set by the Global team. At the beginning of a module, review the objectives to understand what you are working towards. At the end of the module, review again to check you've met your learning goals.
