To start building a successful educational community that can meet these challenges, we can use our curriculum.

{{<note type="definition" title="Definition: curriculum" >}}
The curriculum is a highly structured organisation of resources and tools to guide a community in its educational development
{{</note>}}

In particular, the curriculum is a guide for:

- planning Saturday sessions
- navigating workshops and activities on Github
- sequencing content over the course
- defining learning objectives over a course
- organising content into a modular form
