Early in most day plans, we use the morning orientation to gather the community together. We nominate a time-keeper and a facilitator (if they weren't already nominated during the week).

Most sections have written down objectives. It's useful to know _why_ we're doing something, before we start doing it.

### Steps 👣

1. Find a day plan view where the morning orientation is used
1. Read the learning objectives on the morning orientation
1. Volunteer to be the facilitator or timekeeper (you don't need to volunteer every week!)
