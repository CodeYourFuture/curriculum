We use the morning orientation block to gather the community together. We nominate a time-keeper and a facilitator (if they weren't already nominated during the week). The objectives of the morning orientation block are clear:

### Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Find a day plan view where the morning orientation is used
1. Check the learning objectives on the morning orientation block
1. Volunteer to be the facilitator or timekeeper
