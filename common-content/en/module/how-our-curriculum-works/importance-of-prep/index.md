In a flipped learning model, learners are expected to **prepare** before they meet up as a community. Therefore, regular preparation is essential for our community to self-educate together. In each sprint week, we expect trainees to work on the prep section beforehand to start building their mental model of the week's concepts.

Trainees should show up to class with questions and problems they didn't understand from the prep they already did. This means that we can use our in-person time to work together to fix real problems people have!

{{<multiple-choice
question="What is the best use of volunteer time on a class day?"
answers="Reading an introduction of a topic to trainees. | Helping trainees with the questions they had having done the prep work. | Watching trainees read and do work by themselves."
feedback="Think again: Trainees can read material themselves at their own pace at home. | Right! Working together on real problems is a great use of in-person time. | Not quite: Just watching people do their own work is quite boring and doesn't add much value."
correct="1" >}}
