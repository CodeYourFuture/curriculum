In a flipped learning model, learners are expected to **prepare** before they meet up as a community. Therefore, regular preparation is essential for our community to self-educate together. In each sprint week, we expect trainees to work on the prep section beforehand to start building their own mental model of the week's concepts.

Here is an example of prep from JS1 to gain an example of what trainees will be expected to engage with before an in-person session: https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js1/sprints/1/prep/
