It's important that software works and that people can use it

{{</note>}}
Building working products is our job as software engineers: we must use our skills to make stuff! At the end of every module, you will draw on the skills and concepts you've developed to build a working product for your portfolio. Your product must be deployed and easily accessible to other non-technical users, along with a clear description of its purpose and functionality.

This is important for a few reasons:
1. It will give you practice to help build your skills.
2. It will help you to check that you understand everything you've been taught, as well as why it's useful.
3. It will provide an example you can use to prove to other people (e.g. employers) that you can do what you say you can do.
