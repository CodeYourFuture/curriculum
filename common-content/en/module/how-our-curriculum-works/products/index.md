It's important that software works and that people can use it

{{</note>}}
Building working products is our job as software engineers: we must use our skills to make stuff! At the end of every module, you will draw on the skills and concepts you've developed to build a working product for your portfolio. Your product must be deployed and easily accessible to other non-technical users, along with a clear description of its purpose and functionality.
