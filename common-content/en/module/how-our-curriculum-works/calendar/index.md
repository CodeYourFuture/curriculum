## Join the [Global Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y29kZXlvdXJmdXR1cmUuaW9fdG00MDN0NTlmNWJzcjlocm10bGVyN2RiaThAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

Each day has an activity, and each week has a rhythm. We use Google Calendar to keep track of our activities and rhythms. Subscribe to this calendar and schedule your own week.

Each Meet link is permanently available in the calendar event, so you can join at any time in the day, not just the suggested time. It's a good idea to make a plan with other people to meet at a specific time.
