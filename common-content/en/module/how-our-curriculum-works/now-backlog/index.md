Now that you've finished the prep for this sprint, find the backlog for the Sprint and work through the items. When you've done this, find the Success page for the module, and make sure you've completed all of the learning objectives.

There should be a link to the next page (Backlog) at the bottom of this one. You can also get to the Sprint overview page (which links to Prep, Backlog, Success, and anything else relevant) by clicking the name of the Sprint at the top of the page.

Every sprint you do follows this pattern which you should follow. Look at the overview for the sprint, and work through the pages in order.
