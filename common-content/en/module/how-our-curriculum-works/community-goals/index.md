To achieve our mission, we bring people together to build self-empowered communities of learners. To this end, we have 3 community goals for achieving our mission:

### We build communities that can **self-educate**

**Self educate** means the ability to draw on surrounding resources to learn new skills and concepts. Tech changes all the time. We must develop independent learners who can teach themselves new skills and technologies.

### We build communities that can self-coordinate

**Self-coordinate** means the ability to make things happen with the people we have. Code Your Future isn't a large company with lots of staff. We're a community of motivated people who want to help each other. We can't expect someone else will do everything - we need to make sure we get it done ourselves.

This doesn't mean we can't ask for help - we can - but we need to make sure we make the best use of the knowledge and abilities of everyone around us.

If a trainee thinks we need a extra time learning a topic, they should suggest it! If a volunteer thinks a workshop on a topic would be helpful, they should give one, or find someone else who can.

### We build communities that can self-evaluate

**Self-evaluating** means _we_ work out what we're doing well at, and what we need to improve. If you don't understand a topic, you should identify this and get help. If you're expecting to get code review and no one has reviewed your code, you should raise this problem and get help.

Don't assume someone else will notice you problems and fix them. Every piece of prep, every sprint, every module has learning objectives. Check them before and after you do them. If you aren't confident you understand the learning objectives, talk about it.
