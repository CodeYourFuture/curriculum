To achieve our mission, we bring people together to build self-empowered communities of learners. To this end, we have 3 community goals for achieving our mission:

### We build communities that can **üí° self-educate**

**Self educate** means the ability to draw on surrounding resources to learn new skills and concepts. Tech changes all the time. We must develop independent learners who can teach themselves new skills and technologies.

### We build communities that can **üïê self-coordinate**

**Self-coordinate** means the ability to make things happen with the people we have. Code Your Future isn't a large company with lots of staff. (1-2 technical people on staff, worldwide.) We're a community of motivated people who want to help each other. We can't expect someone else will do everything - we need to make sure we get it done ourselves.

We use the collective intelligence we have built up over the years to coordinate our courses. This means many problems _have_ been solved by others and many logistical "rules of the road" have been discovered collectively. We all use tools like [classplanner](https://classplanner.codeyourfuture.io/), [dashboard](https://dashboard.codeyourfuture.io/), Slack, [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Table-of-Contents), and most importantly the curriculum plan to coordinate courses and help new people join our community. But on the ground, there are always unique learning journeys that need supporting, arising from the unique mix of people in each class.

We are always pragmatic and outcomes focused. If a learner thinks we need a extra time learning a topic, they should suggest it! If a volunteer thinks a workshop on a topic would be helpful, they should give one, or find someone else who can.

### We build communities that can **üìù self-evaluate**

**Self-evaluating** means _we_ work out what we're doing well at, and what we need to improve. If you don't understand a topic, you must identify this and get help. If you're expecting to get code review and no one has reviewed your code after a week or so, you must raise this problem and get help.

Every piece of prep, every sprint, every module has learning objectives. Check them before and after you do them. If you aren't confident you understand the learning objectives, talk about it.

### Communities of adults helping each other

Don't assume someone else will notice your problems and fix them. Everybody in our community has agreed to help each other; we must also agree to ask for the specific help we need, or we can't win this game!

**Mentors**, it's so important that you ask questions and model asking for help in productive and methodical ways too. It's really hard to ask for help; it's even harder to ask for help in ways that make it easy for others to help us. Everybody in our community is always learning and working on this very difficult skill.

Let's work on being curious, humble, brave and kind together. What a team we can be! üöÄ
