[Active learning](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111) is at the heart of our educational philosophy. It is about encouraging learners to build, explore and discuss new concepts instead of being passive recipients of knowledge.

Each adult learner is unique, with their own background, experiences and existing knowledge. It doesn't make sense to assume what people do and do not know already, or to broadcast the same information to everyone. Instead, we use questions to find out what people already know, and help each individual bridge their gap to meeting the course goals.

With active learning we ask specific, targeted questions to find out what we _do not yet know_, so we can work on that together.
