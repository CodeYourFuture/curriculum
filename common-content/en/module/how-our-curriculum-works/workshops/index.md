We do at least one active learning [Workshops](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/) every class day.
Workshops are group activities where the community discusses, solves and reflects on problems related to their current sprint. They are an opportunity for practice, critical thinking and dialogue.

We collectively develop workshops here at this repo: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/
Check out some examples and raise a PR if you've got an idea for a new workshop.
