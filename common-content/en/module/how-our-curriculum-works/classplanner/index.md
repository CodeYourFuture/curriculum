We use Classplanner to manage Saturday rotas per region, so we can all see who is volunteering and when. This is currently just for volunteers, but we are working on expanding it to include learners.

### 🤹🏽 Course Leaders

Course Leaders, [register your course](https://classplanner.codeyourfuture.io/London/newcourse/)s and [classes](https://classplanner.codeyourfuture.io/London/newclass/) in Class Planner and add links to the curriculum and class agenda. Share these newly-created volunteering opportunities with the CYF volunteer community, usually via Slack or the volunteer weekly newsletter.

It's important to **schedule your course in advance**, so volunteers can commit and add the classes to their own calendars. Do this before the start of the course, so volunteers can plan their availability. Help your team help you!

### 🙋🏽 Volunteers

Volunteers, view classes scheduled in your region (choose /cities), and sign up to those which suit your expertise and availability. You can commit to a half-day or full day on your chosen dates.

It's important to **sign up for classes in advance** so that everyone knows what is happening and who will be there. Check the schedule against your own calendar and commit to the Saturdays you know you can be available. If you are sick or have an emergency, let your team know as soon as possible so they can find a replacement. Don't leave your team in the lurch!
