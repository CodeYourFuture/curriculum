This section is for volunteers. To evaluate your capacity to run a class, here are some rules of thumb:

### How many learners make a class?

Fewer than 8 is too small. A class of 18 is a good size. A class of 30 is too large.

### How many volunteers do we need?

1 volunteer can support 3-5 learners.

### What does a class do?

The basic tasks are:

- [Morning workshop](https://workshops.codeyourfuture.io/) on class day
- Afternoon study group. You can also do the following tasks during study group, or async online during the week:
  - [Code review](/prs-needing-review): at least one per learner per sprint
  - [Step review](https://dashboard.codeyourfuture.io/): one per learner per module
  - Pair programming: at least one per learner per module
  - Demo: attend at least one demo by a learner per module

There are additional beneficial activities you can support learners with:

- Rhythm of the week
- Mid-week study sessions online
- Codewars club
- Socials, games nights, meetups
