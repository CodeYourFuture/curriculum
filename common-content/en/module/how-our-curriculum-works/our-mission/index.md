CodeYourFuture helps people who need it most to reach their goal of working in tech. We are a grassroots movement that empowers communities with the resources they need to educate themselves and prepare for a career in the 21st-century tech industry.

At CodeYourFuture, our goal is to get our trainees good jobs in tech. Graduation is not the goal. Graduation is a personal achievement on the road towards success, but the _goal_ is a good job in tech. When talking about 'successful' graduates, we mean employable, so we define this as a graduate with a good job in tech.

Members of CYF without the right to work are not included in our employment statistics, but we prepare them for this same outcome to help them to be successful in the future.

### How are good jobs in tech defined? 

Let's define a good job as:
* A fair, safe, and respectful work environment
* A starting salary around (or above) the median household income, or with clear progression towards this 
* Opportunities for career advancement
* Something you are interested in and enjoy

A job is considered "in tech" if:
* Most of the job's role helps to produce software or hardware, or helps a customer to use technology
* The work done in the job couldn't be done without some technical background

Some examples of jobs in tech:
* A developer role in any company
* A DevOps/Cloud role in any company
* A product or delivery role in a software development team
* A QA or test role in a software development team
* A support desk role helping customers to use software effectively
* A UX/UI role in a software development team
