Often learners try to rush through the curriculum by completing the coursework without evaluating their work. However, our ultimate goal is to build understanding and learn new skills. Our coursework is the means of achieving this goal but not the ultimate goal itself. Learning without evaluation will lead to weak or absent comprehension.

Therefore, code reviews are essential for evaluating our work. They aren’t about grading; they initiate a **[dialogue](../../../how-our-curriculum-works/sprints/self-educate/prep/#dialogue)** starting with constructive feedback about a piece of work. This means you _reply_ to the comments and _make changes_ based on this feedback. This is how you develop your skills. The learning comes from reading and responding, from participating in this dialogue.

Code review is also one way we develop professional technical communication, which is one of the most valuable skills we can give people on this course.
