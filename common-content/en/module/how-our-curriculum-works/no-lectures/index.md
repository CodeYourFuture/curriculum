We don’t give traditional frontal lectures during live sessions. We are not against lectures though; if you want to deliver a lecture, that’s great! Put it on YouTube and send us the link. Students can then watch lectures at their own pace, with captions, pause, and rewind enabled.

At MigraCode Barcelona we have to _maximise the time we have together_, by working in person on projects, hitting blockers, and learning together. We are not a school. We are a community of professionals coming together to share skills and build real things to help people get real jobs inside one year.

Time is very important at MigraCode. We try our best to use everyone's time as well as we can. We want to use our time together to help learners with the things they can't do at home: debugging, pair programming, code review, and building projects.
