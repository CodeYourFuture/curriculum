We don’t lecture trainees during live sessions. We are not against lectures; if you want to deliver a lecture, that’s great! Put it on YouTube and send us the link. Trainees can then watch lectures at their own pace, with captions, pause, and rewind enabled. Trainees also have free accounts kindly donated by Udemy and you can assign any Udemy for Business course.

At {{<our-name>}} we have to _maximise the time we have together_, by working in person on projects, hitting blockers, and learning together. We are not a school. We are a community of professionals coming together to share skills and build real things to help people get real jobs inside one year.

Time is very important at {{<our-name>}}. We try our best to use everyone's time as well as we can. We want to use our time together to help learners with the things they can't do at home: debugging, pair programming, code review, and building projects.
