* **Come on time when you're learning.**
   * Many people give up their free time to teach us. They could be doing other things. We should respect this and always be on time.

* **Clean up after ourselves.**
   * Kind people let us use their space. We should keep it tidy and clean, just like our own homes.

* **Talk to each other (in English).**
   * Put Slack on your phone and computer. Use it to ask for help and talk about classes.
   * Speaking English helps everyone get better at it. Even if you know someone's language, try to use English.

* **Learn to find answers yourself.**
   * We teach you how to look things up. Try to use Google to answer your own questions.

* **Use the computer yourself.**
   * Don't let volunteers or peers type for you. Ask for help, but do the work on your own.

* **Help each other out.**
   * You're all learning together. You can understand each other's problems. Ask for help and offer it too. Explaining things to others helps you learn more.
    
* **We're all part of this.**
   * This isn't just a coding school. It's for all of us - participants, trainees, volunteers. Try to make it better in any way you can.
