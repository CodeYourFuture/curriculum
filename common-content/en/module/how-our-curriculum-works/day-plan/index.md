Cohorts meet once a week in person. Together, we develop our understanding of the topics we are working on this week. We use a **day plan** to organise this day. A day plan is an agenda with workshops, study sessions and activities to make the most of our time together.

There's a day plan for every sprint of every module. Each day plan lists a series of activities, with timings, instructions, and links to resources.
