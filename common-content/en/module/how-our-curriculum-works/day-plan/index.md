Cohorts meet once a week in person. Together, we develop our understanding of the topics we are working on this week. We use a **day plan** to organise this day. A day plan is an agenda with workshops, study sessions and activities to make the most of our time together.

There's a day plan for every sprint of every module. Each day plan lists a series of activities, with timings, instructions, and links to resources.

Find the day plan for the first sprint in the first module. Read the day plan. It's your plan for class day and if you click the times, a countdown timer will start. ✨
