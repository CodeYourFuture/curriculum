Cohorts meet once a week in person.  Together, we develop our understanding of the topics we are working on this week. We use a **day plan** to organise this day. A day plan is an agenda with workshops, study sessions and activities to make the most of our time together. 

There's a day plan for every sprint of every module. Each day plan lists a series of activities, with timings, instructions, and links to resources.

### Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Go to the [module page for HTML-CSS](../../../html-css/)
1. Briefly check the day plans for each sprint in this module
1. Which blocks recur most often? Why do you think this is the case?
