We learn best when we ask questions and explore possible answers. Dialogue is a conversation that facilitates this playful exploration: participants **listen to each other**, **share ideas**, **build on each other's ideas**, and **respectfully challenge and evaluate these ideas**.

In any dialogue, some will know more about a given topic - this will always be the case. However, this difference is an opportunity to learn from someone else's experience and knowledge: it isn't one person's job to give answers. Instead, it's a chance for learners to ask questions, try out answers, and reflect on their thinking. An excellent educational dialogue is one where participants negotiate towards a shared understanding.
