The idea behind CodeYourFuture started brewing in the summer of 2016. Working in the tech industry, CEO and co-founder Germán wanted to find a way to make a positive impact on people's lives through technology. He had observed the invaluable contributions of developers to organizations of various sizes and saw the potential for empowering individuals with coding skills.

During the European refugee crisis of 2015, the UK experienced a negative perception toward forcibly displaced people, despite many individuals lacking personal interactions with refugees or asylum seekers. Seeking guidance, Germán connected with Gijs Cortens, the founder of HackYourFuture, who provided valuable support during the early stages of establishing CodeYourFuture.

In mid-October 2016, CodeYourFuture launched its first class with ten students from diverse backgrounds, including Syria, Afghanistan, India, Ethiopia, and a stateless individual. This marked the foundation of the London chapter. [An article published in Refugee Deeply](https://deeply.thenewhumanitarian.org/refugees/articles/2016/10/19/welcome-to-londons-refugee-coding-school) provides a detailed account of the launch of the first class. When interviewed during the launch of the first class in 2016, German said:

> “The tech industry is facing a huge challenge to find developers to fill the ever-increasing number of vacancies and, at the same time, to increase the diversity of their workforce to help serve their customers better,” he explains. “Training refugees to become developers represents a great opportunity to address both issues.”

CodeYourFuture expanded its focus in 2019 to include locally-born disadvantaged adults. Many of these adults face challenges in finding meaningful work in their home country due to a lack of resources. CodeYourFuture aims to bridge this gap by providing them with essential skills and opportunities.
