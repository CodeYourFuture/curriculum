{{<note type="Exercise">}}
Write a frontend and backend for our chat application.

Remember, the two requirements we have to start with are:
1. As a user, I can send add a message to the chat.
2. As a user, when I open the chat I see the messages that have been sent by any user.

But soon we'll be adding:

3. As a user, when someone sends a message, it gets added to what I see.

As well as some of the other requirements.

It's useful to remember what we're going to do next - it may impact how we do things now.

But for now, our _main_ focus should be our two first requirements.

{{<note type="Exercise">}}
Run your frontend and backend together locally.

Test that it works as we expect. Send several messages. Refresh the page. Make sure you see all of the message (in the correct order).
