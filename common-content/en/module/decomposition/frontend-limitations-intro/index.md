You've made {{<tooltip title="Static" text="static">}}_Static_ has a lot of different meanings in different contexts.<br /><br />Here we mean: The same files are always served from a server to a browser - no extra processing is done by the server to work out how to respond to a request.{{</tooltip>}} websites, both as part of the "world-wide web" reading, and in previous courses/modules.

These were HTML pages, which perhaps included some JavaScript. The JavaScript made them interactive. But they were still static.

A static website is one where your web browser requests some files from a server, and all the web server does is hand over the files.

From that point on, your web browser works on its own. Any event handlers, timers, etc are processed by the web browser.

The job of the server was just to hand over files. Those files are the same, no matter what user asked for them, or what computer they were using.

We often call these static files a **frontend**.

We can build impressive, useful websites with just a frontend. We can include images, videos, and sounds. We can react to user input. We can change what we show on the page. We can even use things like [the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) to store data so that if you leave the page and come back, your data is still there.

Almost all of this curriculum website, for instance, is a static site. It contains a lot of content. It is interactive (e.g. has quizzes). A few small parts of it are not, e.g. the attendance register in the day plan uses a backend to store data.

But frontends also have limitations.

### Limitations of a frontend

Four major limitations of a website which only has a frontend are:
1. We only have access to information we knew when we made the frontend.
2. We can't share information across computers.
3. We can't interact with other users.
4. Everything is public.

Let's talk about each of these.
