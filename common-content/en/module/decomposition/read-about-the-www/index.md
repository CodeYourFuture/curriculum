{{<note type="Reading">}}
Read chapter 12 of How Computers Really Work.

In the "Languages of the Web" section, you can skip the following sub-sections if you want because you probably already know what they say:
* Structuring the Web with HTML
* Styling the Web with CSS
* Scripting the Web with JavaScript

But you should still read the Structuring the Web's Data with JSON and XML sub-section.

Do every exercise listed in the chapters.

Do projects 36-40. You can do these on any Unix-based computer.
