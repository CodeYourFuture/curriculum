You are going to make a chat application which lets multiple users exchange messages.

You've seen a similar application in the quote application. This time, you will be writing all of the code yourself.

Let's think about some requirements for our application:
* As a user, I can send add a message to the chat.
* As a user, when I open the chat I see the messages that have been sent by any user.
* As a user, when someone sends a message, it gets added to what I see.
* As a user, I can "like" or "dislike" someone's message.
* When messages are liked or disliked, a count of the likes and dislikes is displayed next to the message.
* As a user, I can schedule a message to be sent at some time in the future.
* As a user, I can change the colour messages that I send.
* As a user, I can make some words in my messages bold, italic, or underlined.
* As a user, I can indicate that my message is a reply to another message.

We can imagine other requirements too (e.g. reacting with emojis, being able to edit or delete messages, registering exclusive use of a username, ...). We will stick just to the requirements we've listed. In fact, the requirements we've listed are probably more than we have time to implement, so we will need to prioritise them and choose which ones we have time to build. Think about which requirements are _absolutely_ required - we will definitely need to build those!

Because users want to see things, we know we'll need a frontend.

Because multiple users want to be able to share information (messages), we know we'll need a backend for them to communicate via.

### What we already know and what's new

Some of these requirements are similar to the quote server we've already implemented:
* Adding messages is like adding quotes.
* Seeing messages is like seeing quotes.

Others are new:
* Live updates
* Interacting with a message
* Scheduling sending messages.
* Changing colour of messages.
* Formatting specific parts of a message.
* Replying to messages.

First let's make a backend and a frontend to do what we already know. This shouldn't take us very long (we know how to do it, and have done it recently). It will give us a useful framework to experiment with the things that are new to us.

If we thought it would take us a long time to do what we already know, we may approach this differently. We would probably try to work out the new things first. Because they may change how we want to do everything. But because it should be quick to do what we do know, we'll start there.
