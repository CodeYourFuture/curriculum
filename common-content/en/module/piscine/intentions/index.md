The goal of the Piscine is to assess trainees' current knowledge. We are _not_ aiming to teach them any new skills. To be fair, we need to give everyone the same level of support, and we have set that same level at none.

As a **facilitator**, your goal is _not_ to help the trainees with their projects. It is to unblock any logistic problems people run into with the course.

As an **assessor**, your goal is to provide meaningful feedback to help the trainees to grow. For demos, we provide this feedback after each demo. For projects, we provide this feedback after the interview is complete.

There is currently one exception to this: [Breaking down a project to work on as a group is a skill not currently taught in ITP](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum/issues/1441). Until this is resolved, we host a single, consistent workshop on this in the first sprint.
