The goal of the Piscine is to assess trainees' current knowledge. We are _not_ aiming to teach them any new skills. To be fair, we need to give everyone the same level of support, and we have set that same level at none.

As a **facilitator**, your goal is _not_ to help the trainees with their projects. It is to unblock any logistic problems people run into with the course.

As an **assessor**, your goal is to provide meaningful feedback to help the trainees to grow. For demos, we provide this feedback after each demo. For projects, we provide this feedback after the interview is complete.

If you feel a rubric clarification is needed, coordinate with the other assessors before providing this clarification. We need to make sure everyone gets the same clarification.

Below is a list of learning objectives that are not currently taught in ITP, and how we handle them in the Piscine:

| Learning Objective | How we handle it |
| -------------------|------------------|
| [Break down a project to work on as a group in parallel](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum/issues/1441) | We teach this in a workshop in sprint 1 |
| [Test a project reasonably thoroughly](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/curriculum/issues/1616) | We only require one non-trivial test |
| Anticipate and prevent time-zone and daylight-savings bugs | Time-related project briefings, contain warnings and guidance |
