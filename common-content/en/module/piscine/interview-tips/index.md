A few things it's useful to know about interviews:
* You don't need a script. The best way to prepare is to understand your code, and to try explaining it to someone.
* You are allowed to look at your code. It's much easier to talk about code you're looking at!
* Ideally you should share your screen and show the code you're talking about.
  * Be ready to open any of your projects in VSCode, and share your screen.
* You can practice on the interviewing platform we use. Ask in your class Slack channel how to do this.
* Your interviewer wants to see you at your best, not catch you out. Small mistakes aren't the end of the world. Your interviewer isn't expecting you to say everything exactly perfectly. They're looking to see how you think about and explain things.
* It's the interviewer's job to get the information they need. If you don't fully answer a question, they will ask a follow-up question. You don't need to read their mind.
