You probably aren't sure exactly what the Piscine will be like.

Take this time to discuss any questions you may have with your facilitator and cohort.

Make sure you know:
* What's expected of you today.
* What's expected of you this week.
* How you should be working as a team.
* How you'll be assessed.
* How you'll hand in your projects.
