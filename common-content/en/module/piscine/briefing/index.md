You probably aren't sure exactly what the Piscine will be like.

Take this time to discuss any questions you may have with your facilitator and cohort.

Make sure you know:
* What's expected of you today.
* What's expected of you this week.
* How you should be working as a team.
* How you'll be assessed.
  * Which of your projects, demos, and interview you need to pass, and what it means to pass them.
* When you're expected to show up in person or on calls.
* How you'll hand in your projects.
