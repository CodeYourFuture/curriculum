In team projects, it's important that we break large tasks down into small tasks.

It's also important that we can coordinate across our team. This requires having shared understanding of who will do what, and how the work we do will interact.

Finally, it's important that we arrange tasks so your team isn't blocking yourselves, so you'll want to find ways of working on tasks in parallel.

We will practice this together on the two of the requirements of the project:

- Selecting a user must display the agenda for the relevant user (see manual testing below)
- Submitting the form adds a new topic to revise for the relevant user only

To complete these requirements we'd need to build most of the project! So we'll focus on simplified versions of these requirements:

- When the page loads, display one revision date for one topic from in User 1's stored agenda
- When clicking a button, store {{<tooltip title="hard-coded">}}Hard-coding refers to when developers directly write values or data into code, often replacing variables or user input with static values.{{</tooltip>}} data for User 1's agenda

To complete the full requirements, you can build on the tasks we decide on today.

{{<note type="exercise" title="Breaking down tasks">}}

1. Set a timer for {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}
2. Individually, write down all the tasks that would be needed to complete the simplified requirements above
3. After the timer is up, go around the group and discuss the tasks you came up with. One of the volunteers should write the tasks on a whiteboard
4. Volunteers, discuss any that you think might be missing or that might need breaking down further

Looking ahead to your coursework for the next week, one of your tasks will be to [Refine a ticket](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/The-Piscine/issues/6).

{{<note type="exercise" title="Refining tickets">}}

1. Everyone read the [Refine a ticket coursework task](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/The-Piscine/issues/6), for {{<timer>}}3{{</timer>}}.
2. Get into pairs. Each pair should then pick 2 of the tasks from the whiteboard (it doesn't matter if multiple pairs do the same task). Spend {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}} refining your tickets in your pairs. Make sure you work through **all** of the workflow points.
3. Go around each pair in the group. The pair should pick 1 of their tasks and say what they think the priority, estimate, schedule and type of work the task is, and if there is anything they would need to know before starting the ticket. (Hint: the last point is **important**! Don't skip it!)
4. As a group, pick a task (or two, depending on time) that needs more information. Spend {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}} discussing what actions you could take to ensure everyone has what they need to complete this task?

  TODO: The Piscine is meant to be pure evaluation with no teaching.
  Ideally ITP would provide this experience so we wouldn't need to teach it in the Piscine.
  But right now ITP doesn't teach these skills, so we fill that gap so we're not testing people on things they don't know.
