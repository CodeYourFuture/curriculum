In team projects, it's important that we break large tasks down into small tasks.

It's also important that we can coordinate across our team. This requires having shared understanding of who will do what, and how the work we do will interact.

We will practice this together on the first two requirements of the project.

  TODO: The Piscine is meant to be pure evaluation with no teaching.
  Ideally ITP would provide this experience so we wouldn't need to teach it in the Piscine.
  But right now ITP doesn't teach these skills, so we fill that gap so we're not testing people on things they don't know.
