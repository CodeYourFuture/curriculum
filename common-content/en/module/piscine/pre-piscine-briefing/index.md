Before the Piscine starts, there will be a meeting to brief you on how the Piscine works, and answer any questions.

You will be notified on Slack when this meeting will be.

## For trainees

Before the meeting, think about any questions you have. What are you not sure about?

Make sure you attend the meeting.

## For volunteers

Make sure everyone knows:
* What the schedule of the Piscine is. When are people expected where?
* What people should do before the first session.
* What's expected of trainees in the first session, and in the first week.
* How trainees should be working as a team.
* How trainees will be assessed.
  * Which projects, demos, and interview trainees need to pass, and what it means to pass them.
  * How much to style your projects, and why.
* When trainees are expected to show up in person or on calls.
* How trainees will hand in their projects.
