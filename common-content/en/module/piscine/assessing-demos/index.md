We assess demos against 6 rubric points. A demo must pass any 5 of the 6 points to pass. Trainees must pass at least one demo to pass the course.

We give feedback after every demo, including a run-down of each rubric point.

These are typically our trainees' first demos. We expect significant improvement through the course. The first sprint is expected not to be good (but sometimes is!).

<dl class="c-rubric">
  <dt>Clearly introduce the topic of the demo.</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to state the topic of the demo in one sentence. This topic should match how the trainee introduced their demo. If a trainee said their demo was about writing clear code, but it was actually about how to debug a test failure, they missed this.<br /><br />The topic <strong>must not</strong> be "I will tell you about my project". It must be more specific than a project overview.</dd>
  <dt>Explain what was done</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to state what you have done in one sentence.</dd>
  <dt>Explain the reasoning behind a choice.</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to explain why you did at least one thing a particular way (and why it was a better choice than alternatives).</dd>
  <dt>Show relevant code or artifacts (e.g. a website, a ticket, an discussion).</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to identify at least one artifact of your work.</dd>
  <dt>Stick to your time limit.</dt><dd>You should know how long you have for your demo, and stick to that time. You will be given a warning when you're running low on time. If a trainee is not done speaking at the time limit, they missed this. Finishing early is fine.</dd>
  <dt>(Stretch goal): Ask questions.</dt><dd>Someone watching can state at least one question that was asked of the audience that is not "any questions?". The point of this is to engage the audience and get them thinking/caring about the demo. The question should generally be rhetorical - you don't have time to wait for answers.</dd>

To run a demo:
* Make sure someone is keeping time. They should clearly indicate when the trainee has 30 seconds left, and when they hit their time limit.
* It's ok to let the trainee keep talking for up to about 30 seconds after the time limit, but don't include any content after the time limit in your assessment.
* Give feedback on every demo. Make sure to include an assessment of all six rubric points, as well as any general feedback.
* Note the score of the demo, and at least one sentence of feedback, in the tracker.
