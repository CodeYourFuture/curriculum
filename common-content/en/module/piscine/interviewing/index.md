The last assessment in the Piscine is an interview. The key goals of the interview are:
* Verify that the trainee actually understands the code they've submitted. If they produced it with ChatGPT and can't explain it, they need to focus on code understanding before proceeding.
* Verify that the trainee can discuss code and technical ideas. This is similar to what demos are assessing, but in a more interactive scenario. This is an important skill to get a job.

Each interview is schedule to be 15 minutes. It is ok to run over by 5 minutes. We leave at least 20 minutes between interviews, to give time for things to go wrong and to write up feedback.

If something goes completely wrong (e.g. internet connections drop), try to recover, but if you think an interview can't be fairly completed, assure the trainee they'll be treated fairly, and we'll work out how, e.g. reschedule.

Try to leave the interviewee feeling positive (that they could complete some tasks), but do not mislead them about outcomes. Do not share the outcome of their interview with them in the interview.

After all of the interviews are completed, we gather (ideally on the same day) to make final decisions as a group.

We record all interviews, so that we can get second opinions if needed. We make sure we're calibrated such that everyone would give the same pass/fail decision.

Aim to come to a pass/fail decision on the interview that day, and write up any feedback within 3 days so it can be shared with the trainees.
