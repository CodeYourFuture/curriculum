## Welcome to the Piscine.

Your goal is to build two group projects and one solo project over the next 22 days. For each project, your goal is to:

- 🎯 Build a complete project that meets the requirements, including tests.
- 🎯 Build a complete understanding of all the code in your project, because you will be asked to explain it.

_Our_ goal is to find people who are ready to train in the Software Development Course. This means we are looking for people ready to begin working as a professional software engineer within the next 16 weeks. This is why we are looking at your ability to:

- 🎯 Work in a team to build working software with tests.
- 🎯 Write simple code independently.
- 🎯 Explain your work to others in English.

These are the core goals of the Piscine.
