To smoothly run a Piscine, we ask that that the volunteers running it:
* Attend a weekly meeting to sync on how things are going and flag anything that needs to be consistently resolved.
* Assess projects against their rubric as early as possible after the submission deadline.
  * Leaving this work to batch up at the end is painful, and makes it hard to course-correct any major issues.
  * Wait until the submission deadline - often trainees edit their submissions after they post them.
  * Use the shared template for writing up feedback - this helps us to be consistent, to prepare for interviews, and to collate feedback to present to trainees at the end of the course.
* Fill in the trainee tracker spreadsheet as we go.

On class days, we:
* Attend each week.
* Start punctually at 10:00.
* Treat showing up late as a failure.
* Sometimes take 30 minutes of the ITP class to present demos to the ITP class.
  * We never do this in the first week. First demos are generally bad.
  * But we limit this to 30 minutes to not disrupt the class too much - if we have more demos than that, we give them separately from ITP.
  * Warn our trainees this will be the case in advance, so they know what audience to prepare for.
