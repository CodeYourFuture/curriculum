You are done for the day. Take a moment to reflect on what you have learned and achieved.

Stand in a circle and share:

- 📛 your name
- 💪🏽 one thing you built today
- 👷🏾 the ticket you are going to work on next
- 🛟 one thing you need help with

Give yourselves a round of applause. Now go home and rest. You will need your energy for the project ahead.
