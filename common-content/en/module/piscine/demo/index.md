At {{<our-name>}} we expect you to demo your work to the class. You must have many opportunities to practice how to clearly and simply **explain your work to others**. This is really important for interviews and career success.

## ⏰ Timekeeper

The timekeeper will keep the groups on track.

Split randomly into groups of no more than 4 people. Mix up your teams. Each person will have 2 minutes to demo their work to the group. After the demo, the group will ask questions or give feedback for 5 minutes. Then the next person will demo their work.

## 🧑🏼‍🎓 Trainees

### 1. Demo {{<timer>}}2{{</timer>}}

You will demo something about your project work this sprint to the group.

You will have 2 minutes to explain what you did and why. It's ok to show broken code or code that doesn't work yet. Just make sure your demo is interesting.

### 2. Feedback {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}

After the demo, the group will give you feedback for up to 5 minutes. It's smart to suggest what kind of feedback you want by asking some "generative" questions. For example:

- I wasn't sure if it makes sense to try X. What do you think?
- I liked the way I did X, but I know there are other approaches, what did you do?
- I found X really confusing, did anyone else have the same problem?

## 💡 Tips:

- **Practice** the format of demos before class.
- **Keep it simple**. Don't try to show everything you did. Just show _one_ interesting thing.
- **Keep it short**. Two minutes is enough.
- **Explain** what you did and why.
- **Show** your code.
- **Ask** for feedback.


## Rubric

These are some criteria we will be using to assess your demo. You must meet 5 of the 6 criteria, and if you skip one we recommend you skip asking a question. This is not an ordered list - you can complete these criteria in any order.
<dl class="c-rubric">
  <dt>Clearly introduce the topic of the demo.</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to state the topic of the demo in one sentence. This topic should match how the trainee introduced their demo.<br /><br />The topic <strong>must not</strong> be "I will tell you about my project". It must be more specific than a project overview.</dd>
  <dt>Explain what was done</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to state what you have done in one sentence.</dd>
  <dt>Explain the reasoning behind a choice.</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to explain why you did at least one thing a particular way (and why it was a better choice than alternatives).</dd>
  <dt>Show relevant code or artifacts (e.g. a website, a ticket, an discussion).</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to identify at least one artifact of your work. Slides don't count as an artifact.</dd>
  <dt>Stick to your time limit.</dt><dd>You should know how long you have for your demo, and stick to that time. You will be given a warning when you're running low on time.</dd>
  <dt>(Stretch goal): Ask questions.</dt><dd>Someone watching can state at least one question that was asked of the audience that is not "any questions?". The point of this is to engage the audience and get them thinking/caring about the demo. The question should generally be rhetorical - you don't have time to wait for answers.</dd>
