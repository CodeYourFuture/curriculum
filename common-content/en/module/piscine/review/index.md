You have opened at least one pull request this week and likely several more. (If you have not, your tickets are too big and you need to scope them down.)

In this session, you will review a pull request from a teammate, and they will review yours. You should be doing this during the week anyway, but this session is a chance to talk in person, ask clarifying questions, and make changes together.
