This time is set aside for you to work together as a team to make progress on your project.

Remember: At your interview, you may be asked about _any_ code in your project, not just the code you wrote. You need to understand and be able to explain the code your team mates wrote. Make sure you read their code, review it, and talk to them about it.

Here are some strategies to help you work effectively together:

### 🍅 Pomodoro

</summary>

Each team member take a small-scoped ticket. Set a timer for {{<timer>}}25{{</timer>}}. Use this focused time to complete your ticket and open a PR.

⌛ Time's up! Take a {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} break! Make a cup of tea. Walk around a bit.

Now set a new {{<timer>}}25{{</timer>}} and review each PR as a group.

⌛ Time's up! Take a {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} break! Make a cup of tea. Stretch! Look at how much progress you made in one hour. ✨

### 🧭 Pair programming

</summary>

- Switch between driver and navigator roles after {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}}
- The "driver" is the person typing on the keyboard, just thinking about what needs to be written
- The "navigator" reviews what the driver is doing and is thinking about to write next
- Don't dominate - this is teamwork

⌛ Time's up! Take a {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} break! Make a cup of tea. Good job, partners!

### 🚧 Blockers

</summary>

Identify any blockers or dependencies in your project. What must be done first? What can be "decoupled" and done in parallel? The better you can identify these, the more efficient your team will be. Discuss these blockers as a team and decide how to solve them while you are all together and can help each other.

#### Describe your blocker

Describing the problem systematically will take you most of the way to resolving the blocker. Use the following template on a ticket on your board:

1. **What you did**: Describe what you have done so far. Give links and code snippets.
1. **What you expected**: Describe what you expected to happen.
1. **What actually happened**: Describe what actually happened.

Blockers can feel frustrating, but in reality they are opportunities to explore and solve problems. This is what engineering is all about. 🌱
