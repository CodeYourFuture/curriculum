When you're working on group projects, we expect you to be working together.

You can work on code on your own, but we expect you to be aware of what each other is working on.

At your interview, you may be asked about any code in your project, including code someone else wrote.

We **strongly** recommend that you collaborate as you go. Read and discuss each other's code _as you're building_. Do not wait until the end of the project (or the week before the interview).
