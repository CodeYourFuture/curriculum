Identify any blockers or dependencies in your project. What must be done first? What can be "decoupled" and done in parallel? The better you can identify these, the more efficient your team will be. Discuss these blockers as a team and decide how to solve them while you are all together and can help each other.

#### Describe your blocker

Describing the problem systematically will take you most of the way to resolving the blocker. Use the following template on a ticket on your board:

1. **What you did**: Describe what you have done so far. Give links and code snippets.
1. **What you expected**: Describe what you expected to happen.
1. **What actually happened**: Describe what actually happened.

Blockers can feel frustrating, but in reality they are opportunities to explore and solve problems. This is what engineering is all about. ðŸŒ±
