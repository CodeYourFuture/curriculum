This time is set aside for you to make progress on your solo project. But remember, you are not alone! You have your mentors and peers to help you. Here are some strategies to help you work effectively:

### 👤 User stories

</summary>

> As a [who], I can [what] so that **[why]**

Spend some time working on your initial {{<tooltip title="user stories ">}}A user story is a short sentence stating some goal a user can expect to achieve when _using_ the product we are building.{{</tooltip>}}. Write them as tickets on your planning board.

1. **Identify described requirements**: What are the requirements of your project? What are the features you need to build? Describe them in user story format.
1. **Create a strategy**: How will you implement these user stories? What are the steps you need to take to complete them? Update your tickets with this information.
1. **Express as test cases**: How will you know when you have completed the user story? What tests can you write to verify that the user story is complete? Write these tests.

Use this opportunity to compare your user stories with others and ask for feedback in real time. 🌟 Everyone will approach the project differently, and you can get feedback to test your ideas.

### 🚧 Blockers

</summary>

Identify any blockers or dependencies in your project. What must be done first? What can be "decoupled" and done in any order? What parts will you need to research or ask for help from others? What parts are you confident about? Mark these on your board.

#### Describe your blocker

Describing the problem systematically will take you most of the way to resolving the blocker. Use the following template on a ticket on your board:

1. **What you did**: Describe what you have done so far. Give links and code snippets.
1. **What you expected**: Describe what you expected to happen.
1. **What actually happened**: Describe what actually happened.

Blockers can feel frustrating, but in reality they are opportunities to explore and solve problems. This is what engineering is all about. 🌱
