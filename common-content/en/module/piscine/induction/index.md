## 🎯 Goals

Your goal is to build two group projects and one solo project over the next 21 days.

## 🧰 Expectations

- You are expected to work in groups and individually, in class and during the week.
- You are expected to show up on time and participate in all activities.
- You are expected to complete the projects in the way they are specified.
- You can expect your team to work _with_ you to complete the projects.
- You can expect the {{<our-name>}} volunteers to help you with your code and blockers.
- You can expect your assessment to be explained clearly.
- We expect everyone to follow the Code of Conduct.

## 💡 Help

You are not competing against each other for limited number of places. We will accept everyone who meets the criteria.

- You should ask for help
- You should help others
- Volunteers and other candidates will help you with your code and blockers, _but_ you must make sure you understand the code in your projects, because you will be asked to explain it.

## 🧑🏿‍🎓 Activities

- Read through the day plans so you know what to expect.
- Each class day will have time set aside for development and review where you can ask questions and get help.
- Everyone will demo on every class day, and a random demo will be assessed.

## 🧪 Assessment

- The fourth class day will be interview day. A panel will ask you questions about your code and your projects. You can be asked about any part of your project, so make sure you understand it all, including the parts your teammates wrote.

The success criteria is listed on the success page. Read it carefully so you know what you need to do to succeed.
