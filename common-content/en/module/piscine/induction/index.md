Welcome to the Piscine.

Before you came to class today, you should have completed the prep and signed the Trainee Agreement and the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't done the prep, it's time to leave. Thanks, and try again next time.

If you have done the prep, you're in the right place. Please make sure you have signed the register. Sign it as soon as you come in. The register isn't just for attendance rules; we need to know who is in the building if there's a fire, so please don't sign in for anyone else.

Next up, we need to choose a timekeeper. The timekeeper is responsible for keeping us on track and making sure we finish on time. Who would like to volunteer?

#### ⏰ The Timekeeper will:

</summary>

- [ ] Announce the start of an activity and how long it will take (check everyone is listening)
- [ ] Manage any whole class timers that are used in an activity
- [ ] Give people a 10-minute wrap-up warning before the end of an activity
- [ ] Announce the end of an activity and what happens next
</details>

Today you will kick off your first team project. Everyone will also give a demo about something they did before the Piscine. At the end of the day, we will wrap and people are welcome to stick around to socialise.

But first, let's get to know each other. Stand up and find someone you don't know. Introduce yourself and tell them one thing you are looking forward to learning in the Piscine.
