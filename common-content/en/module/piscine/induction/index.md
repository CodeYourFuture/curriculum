Welcome to the Piscine.

Before you came to class today, you should have completed the prep and attended a briefing session. If you haven't done these things, it's time to leave. Thanks, and try again next time.

If you have done the prep, you're in the right place. Please make sure you have signed the register. Sign it as soon as you come in. The register isn't just for attendance rules; we need to know who is in the building if there's a fire, so please don't sign in for anyone else.

Today you will kick off your first team project. Everyone will also give a demo about something they did before the Piscine. At the end of the day, we will wrap and people are welcome to stick around to socialise.

But first, let's get to know each other. Stand up and find someone you don't know. Introduce yourself and tell them one thing you are looking forward to learning in the Piscine.
