Open [this Clean Code workshop presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G6XjmL7U9013v0Pw9R5nHrzRdWdnNzdbDUBMy_gdJpk/edit). Work through the whole thing together as a group. The "Gilded Rose" Kata is not required to be done in class, but we recommend you try it on your own after class if you didn't get to it.

For each "Better or worse?" question, every member of the class should move to one side of the room or the other to vote for which piece of code they prefer.

People who voted each way should share with the class why they prefer the code they voted for.
