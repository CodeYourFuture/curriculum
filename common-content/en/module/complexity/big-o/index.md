What does this mean? It means that the time is the square of the input size: n\*n.

You will find that you already have a basic understanding of this idea. Let's look at these algorithms in real life:

{{<label-items heading="Drag the time complexity categories onto the correct examples">}}
[LABEL=Constant Time]

- Finding your own parked car in your designated spot. Doesn't matter if the car park has 10 spots or 1000, finding your spot takes the same time.
  [LABEL=Logarithmic Time]
- Finding a name in a physical dictionary or **sorted** phone book. You open to the middle, decide which half the name is in, and repeat. Each step halves the problem. Adding way more pages doesn't increase the search time proportionally.
  [LABEL=Linear Time]
- Reading every page of a book in order to find a specific word. If the book doubles in length, it takes roughly double the time.
  [LABEL=Quadratic Time]
- Everyone at a party shaking hands with everyone else. If you double the number of people (n), the number of handshakes increases much faster (roughly n \* n).
  [LABEL=Exponential Time]
- Trying every possible combination to unlock a password. Each extra character dramatically increases the possibilities.
  {{< /label-items >}}

<figure>
<figcaption>Now let's match those concepts to the notation:</figcaption>

{{<label-items heading="Drag the time complexity notations onto their descriptions">}}
[LABEL=O(1)]

- Constant Time
  [LABEL=O(log n)]
- Logarithmic Time
  [LABEL=O(n)]
- Linear Time
  [LABEL=O(n2)]
- Quadratic Time
  [LABEL=O(2n)]
- Exponential Time

{{< /label-items >}}

</figure>

Now let's match those concepts to real code we can write:

{{<label-items heading="Drag the time complexity notations onto the correct code examples">}}
[LABEL=O(1)]

- Accessing a list element by index: `my_list[5]`
  [LABEL=O(log n)]

- Binary search.

[LABEL=O(n)]

- Finding the largest number in an unsorted list.

[LABEL=O(n2)]

- Bubble Sort, comparing every element to every other element.  
  [LABEL=O(2n)]

- Naive recursive Fibonacci calculation.

{{< /label-items >}}

{{<note type="activity" title="Activity: Match the Scenario">}}

For each scenario below, decide which Big-O category best describes its time complexity as the input (n) grows. Explain your reasoning briefly in your notebook.

- [ ] Checking if a specific book (n = number of books) is present on a library shelf, assuming the books are not sorted.
- [ ] Delivering a single package to a specific known address (n = number of houses in the city).
- [ ] Finding a specific page number in a book (n = number of pages).
- [ ] A group of n friends all wanting to exchange gifts with every other friend in the group (how many gifts total?).
- [ ] Guessing a secret number between 1 and n by asking "is it higher or lower?" repeatedly.

Practical Limits: Think about the O(n¬≤) party handshakes and the O(2‚Åø) password combinations. Why would these become completely impractical very quickly if n (number of people or password length) got even moderately large (like 100 people or a 20-character password)?
