What does this mean? It means that the time is the square of the input size: n\*n.

You will find that you already have a basic understanding of this idea. No really! Let's look at these algorithms in real life:

{{<label-items heading="Drag the time complexity categories onto the correct examples">}}
[LABEL=Constant Time]

- Finding your own parked car in your designated spot. Doesn't matter if the car park has 10 spots or 1000, finding your spot takes the same time.
  [LABEL=Logarithmic Time]
- Finding a name in a physical dictionary or **sorted** phone book. You open to the middle, decide which half the name is in, and repeat. Each step halves the problem. Adding way more pages doesn't increase the search time proportionally.
  [LABEL=Linear Time]
- Reading every page of a book in order to find a specific word. If the book doubles in length, it takes roughly double the time.
  [LABEL=Quadratic Time]
- Everyone at a party shaking hands with everyone else. If you double the number of people (n), the number of handshakes increases much faster (roughly n \* n).
  [LABEL=Exponential Time]
- Trying every possible combination to unlock a password. Each extra character dramatically increases the possibilities.

You will explore this theory in your backlog. Let's look at some practical examples.
