Caching isn't limited to your browser. 

We can save time by caching the results of operations (answers) at every level in our system: in the database, at the endpoint, in the browser, and even inside our functions. 

### Caching During Execution

Imagine any computation that we do repeatedly on the way to a final result. We could do it once, cache the answer in memory, and reuse it. This is especially helpful in functions that use {{<tooltip title="recursion">}}A [recursive function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion) calls itself, typically until some break condition is met.{{</tooltip>}}

### Problems and subproblems

We have seen that software engineering is mostly breaking down large problems into smaller problems that are easier to solve. [Dynamic programming](https://www.wscubetech.com/resources/dsa/dynamic-programming) is a rigorous application of this idea. We won't cover this topic in depth here.

This is an implementation of the strategy of saving time by spending space.
