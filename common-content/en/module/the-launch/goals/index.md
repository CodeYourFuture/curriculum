Demo Day is when we invite others to see the projects that you have been working on over this module. It's a chance for us all to come together to see what you've achieved!

You'll present your product using a combination of presentations, live demonstrations and videos.

The goals of Demo Day are:

1. **Celebrate your achievements**: You've worked hard over the module, and this is a chance to show off what you've learned and built.
1. **Explain your work to others**: You need to be able to discuss your work fluently. This project will be the key part of your portfolio, so you need to be able to talk about it confidently in interviews.
1. **Get feedback**: You'll get feedback from your peers, mentors and other guests. This feedback will help you improve your project and your presentation skills for the real challenge: job interviews.
