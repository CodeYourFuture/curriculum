### Introduction

- Don't spend time talking about the volunteers that helped with your project - the demo day is about you! (It's fine, the volunteers already know that you appreciate it!)
- It's a good idea to say what type of job that you're interested in - so if you'd like to be a backend dev, say so!

### Presentation

- When you talk about challenges, make sure you say how you solved it. If you didn't manage to solve it, then talk about what you tried to solve it
- Talk about how you communicated and collaborated with each other (Github, Slack, calls, etc). Remember that this is a big part of a developer's day so it's a good idea to show that you have experience of this

### Demo

- Have a script for the demo and practice it! You should be able to talk without thinking too much about it
- Practice switching between demo and slides so that you don't waste too much time on it
- Use tabs to pre-fill forms - we don't need to see you type out stuff, especially if you don't explain it
- Use Incognito mode to prevent logging into/out. With incognito mode, you can be logged into multiple accounts at once
- Consider recording a (silent) video of the demo - what if there's no internet? Or the app goes down? But remember that this is your best chance to make a personal impression; Never stand there silently while a video talks!
- Get someone to hold the mic if you're typing/demoing - then you have two hands!
- Make the font size bigger so people can see it at the back of the room. (Ctrl-+ on Windows/Linux or Cmd-+ on Mac)

#### Common questions after the demo

It's a good idea to prepare answers for these questions:

- What was your biggest challenge?
- How did you handle conflicts in your team?
- If you were starting from scratch would you change anything?
- How did you test your app?
- How does your app work on mobile devices?
- Did you think about accessibility?
