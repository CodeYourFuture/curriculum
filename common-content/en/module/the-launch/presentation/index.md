On the demo day the Launch Module teams will present their products. Each team has 10 minutes to present. You must ensure that you can present within the allocated time.
_Suggestion of split: 7 minutes for the presentation itself and 3 minutes for questions._

Use our [presenting guide](/guides/presenting/) to understand what you should consider when building your demo.
