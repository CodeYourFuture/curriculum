> Complete your project README, explaining what it does and how to use it

- You MUST make sure your README is filled out and presents your project clearly. If it just contains boilerplate information it looks like you haven't done anything, so you may as well just throw your project in the bin! Don't make this basic mistake.
- Make sure your repo is linked on your deployed site and your deployed site is linked on your repo. _Help employers find you._
- Fork your group project to your personal Github and pin it to your profile. _Help employers find you._

Generally imagine that employers are now looking at your work: you are launching into the world!

#### Personal README

You should also complete [your personal README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

A good profile/ Readme has:

- Your name
- A professional profile picture
- Contact details (As a minimum, connect to your Linkedin and Portfolio)
- Your profession (i.e. 'Developer' or 'Software Engineer')
- A list of key skills (3 to 5, no more)
- An introduction to your projects

Don't cover your profile with awards and auto-generated stats.
