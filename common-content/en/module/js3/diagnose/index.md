This is a pairing activity!

Each pair will need to split into navigator and driver.
Volunteers can pair up too - they need to drive though!
Navigators you can read the instructions for this workshop as you get setup

This activity will consist of the following steps:

### 🧑‍💻 Predict ➡️ Explain

Given a program or piece of code, you’ll have to explain what the code currently does. Not what it should do.

### 🔍🐛 Find the bug

Given a target output/behaviour - trainees can identify a bug in the source code

### 🪜🧭 Propose a strategy

Given a problem, you’ll have to think about a strategy for solving it. This doesn’t involve coding but stepping back to think about how you could solve the problem. You might want to talk aloud, draw a flow diagram or write out the steps you’d take in your solution.

For the specific task, check with the facilitator on Saturday.
