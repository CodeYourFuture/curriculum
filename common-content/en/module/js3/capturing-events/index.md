We've introduced our state, and our render works for different values of that state. But users of our website can't change the `searchTerm` state themselves. We need to introduce a way for them to change the `searchTerm` state via the UI.

To listen for the search input event, we can add an {{<tooltip title="event listener">}} An event listener waits for a specific **event** to occur. It runs in response to things like clicks, and key presses. We register listeners with <code>addEventListener</code> by passing the event name and a handling function. {{</tooltip>}}

```js
const searchBox = document.getElementById("search");

searchBox.addEventListener("input", handleSearchInput);

function handleSearchInput(event) {
  // React to input event
}
```

These listeners wait for specific events to occur, and when they do, they trigger a callback function we've defined. This gives us a way to make our code respond to user actions rather than running all at once.

```js
const search = document.getElementById("search");
search.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
```

When we call `addEventListener`, it doesn't immediately execute the `handleInput` function. Instead, it sets up a listener that will run this function later. Event listeners are actually part of the Event API provided by web browsers - they aren't part of the core JavaScript language! When you create an event listener, you're essentially making a request to a Web API to handle this functionality for you. In this pattern, the callback function (`handleInput`) only executes when a user types. We're using functions as containers for code that needs to execute at a later time, specifically in response to user interactions. This approach lets us tell the browser exactly what actions to take once a particular event occurs.

This pattern of using callback functions is fundamental to how we handle user interactions in web browsers. It allows our code to respond dynamically to user actions rather than executing in a simple top-to-bottom manner. The browser takes care of monitoring for events and running our callback functions at the right time, letting us focus on defining what should happen when those events occur.
