We can now render _any one_ film data object in the UI. However, to fully solve this problem we must render a list of all of the film objects. For each film object, we need to render a corresponding film card in the UI. In this case, there is a {{<tooltip title="one-to-one mapping">}}A **one-to-one mapping** associates every element in a set to exactly one element in another set{{</tooltip>}}between the data array and the UI components on the web page. Each item in the array matches a node in the UI. We can represent this diagrammatically by pairing up the data elements with their corresponding UI components:

```mermaid

flowchart LR
   A[datum1] == createFilmCard(datum1) ==> B[UI component 1]
   C[datum2] == createFilmCard(datum2) ==> D[UI component 2]
```

To create an array of card components, we can iterate through the film data using a `for...of` loop:

```js
const filmCards = [];
for (const item of films) {
  filmCards.push(createFilmCard(item));
}

document.body.append(...filmCards);
// invoke append using the spread operator
```

However, there are alternative methods for building this array of UI components.
