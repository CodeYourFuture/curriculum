SDC works just like ITP:
* Each sprint starts on Tuesday.
* You are expected to read all of the prep before coming to class.
* You are expected to look at and start trying all of the backlog items before coming to class.
* Class runs on Saturday
  * In the mornings we do group workshops.
  * There's a _lot_ of time for study group - get help with what you need help with!
  * Every sprint there is time for demos. Practicing giving demos is incredibly important. Work out with your cohort how you want to run these: Should everyone demo every week, or will you take turns? How long should each demo be? What kind of feedback do you want?
* You should finish all of your backlog items, and get your work reviewed. Keep iterating until it's complete.

It's also a bit different from ITP:
* It's much less guided. There's a lot more unstructured time for you to decide what you want to focus on or need help with.
* There are only a few (big) backlog items, rather than lots of small ones. You should break these down and plan them yourself.
* There's less checking and hand-holding. We trust you to do your backlog and get it reviewed. You don't need to submit a step proving you've done so. **But you still need to do the work**. If you haven't finished all the work from two sprints ago, something is wrong, talk about it.
* At the end of each sprint there is a retro. Use this time to discuss what isn't working well, and what you want to change about how your cohort is doing the course.

{{<note type="Discussion">}}
Discuss as a cohort how you will work together.

How do you want to collaborate?

How do you want to do demos?

How do you want to structure Study Group time?

What will you do if you fall behind? How will you get support?
