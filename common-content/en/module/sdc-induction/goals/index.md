The goal of the Software Development Course is for you to learn transferable fundamental skills in software. This will prepare you for many different jobs. You will not be limited to one job style, like "web developer" or "backend engineer". You should be able to apply for any job that involves writing software.

The course uses JavaScript and Python, but gives you foundations to learn any language you need. You can apply for jobs in languages you don't know. (But make sure you know what they expect you to use in an interview!)
