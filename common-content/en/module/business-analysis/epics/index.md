Find some examples of epics, features and user stories. This [resource](https://scrum-master.org/en/epic-feature-and-user-story-in-agile-a-beginners-guide/) may be helpful.

1. Suggest a list of epics for an improved solution within BrightStar

2. Supposing you had limited resources for a first implementation of these changes, decide which of these epics would initially be in scope and justify this choice

3. For one of your epics derive multiple features

4. Show how your lower-level technical requirements can be traced back to higher-level business needs (traceability)
