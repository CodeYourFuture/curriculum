At CYF we expect you to demo your work to the class. You must have many opportunities to practice how to clearly and simply **explain your work to others**. This is really important skill as a business analyst.

## ⏰ Timekeeper

The timekeeper will keep the groups on track.

Split randomly into groups of no more than 4 people. Mix up your teams.
Each person will have 10 minutes to demo the work they did on the previous prep to the group. 
After the demo, the group will ask questions or give feedback for 5 minutes.
Then the next person will demo their work.

## 🧑🏼‍🎓 Trainees

### 1. Demo {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}}

You will demo the work you did for this sprint as if you were presenting it to Brighsparks stakeholders.

You will have 10 minutes to explain run the stakeholders through your findings and logic behind it.

### 2. Feedback {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}

After the demo, the group will give you feedback for up to 5 minutes.
Someone from the group might act as one of the main stakeholders and ask questions.

## 💡 Tips:

- **Practice** the format of demos before class.
- **Keep it simple**. Don't try to show everything you did. Just show enough so it makes sense and shows progress.
- **Keep it short**. 10 minutes is enough.
- **Explain** what you did and why.
- **Show** the artifacts you created
- **Ask** for feedback.


## Rubric

These are some criteria we will be using to assess your demo. You must meet 5 of the 6 criteria, and if you skip one we recommend you skip asking a question. This is not an ordered list - you can complete these criteria in any order.
<dl class="c-rubric">
  <dt>Clearly introduce the topic to the stakeholders (aka the group).</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to approve the next steps.<br /><br />The topic <strong>must not</strong> be "I will tell you about my hard work". It must be about how you, as a Business analyst, evaluated and used the knowledge you acquired.</dd>
  <dt>Explain what was done</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to state what you have done in one sentence.</dd>
  <dt>Explain the reasoning behind a choice.</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to explain why you did at least one thing a particular way (and why it was a better choice than alternatives).</dd>
  <dt>Show relevant artifacts (e.g. business mapping, data mapping, user story).</dt><dd>Someone watching should be able to identify at least one artifact of your work. Slides don't count as an artifact.</dd>
  <dt>Stick to your time limit.</dt><dd>You should know how long you have for your demo, and stick to that time. You will be given a warning when you're running low on time.</dd>
  <dt>Get buy in.</dt><dd>The stakeholders should leave your presentation satisfied with the outcome and direction.</dd>
