You have been given this additional information concerning BrightStar. 
 
Our target demographic is Millennials and Gen Z (18- 40ish), who expect seamless digital and personalised experiences. 

Success metrics:
- Loyalty: 50% increase in digital sign-ups/app downloads (12 months), higher engagement/redemption, improved retention, reduced service calls. 
- Returns: 30% reduction in transaction time, fewer complaints, improved staff efficiency, faster refunds. 
- We prefer modern cloud-based (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) and SaaS solutions with API integration. We want to move away from legacy on-premise systems, but some may stay due to data protection laws. Note: We currently manage different legacy CRM solutions across our food and clothing departments, and a major upgrade to our core accounts/ERP system is also planned next year, which could impact integration timelines. 
- Furthermore, we've experienced some challenges with our previous external mobile development partner, so vendor selection for any new app is critical. Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration is a plus
