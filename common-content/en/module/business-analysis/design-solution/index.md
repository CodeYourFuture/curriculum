Considering all the content of your the use case, can you design a possible solution for it? 
 
This can include any of the design elements (eg. storyboards, use cases, functional architecture, data models or class diagrams) already provided above or additional ones. 

Pull these together to produce a coherent overall picture of your solution, which you are able to present.
