Read about [acceptance criteria](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/need-know-acceptance-criteria) and how user stories can be made both more measurable and clearly understandable for developers. 
 
For one of the user stories that you have so far identified for BrightStar, suggest 3 or more acceptance criteria.
