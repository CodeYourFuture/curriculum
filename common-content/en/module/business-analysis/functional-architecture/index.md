[This page](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2020teamb/design/functional-architecture/) has an example of a functional architecture. Can you find any more? 

1. Using one example of a functional architecture, show what universal design principles have (or have not!) been followed 
 
2. Propose a functional architecture for part (or all) of the BrightStar solution 
 
3. Describe the interaction among two or more component modules within your functional architecture using a sequence diagram
