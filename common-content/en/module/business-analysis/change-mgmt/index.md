1. What is [change management](https://youtu.be/wxVgd8h1svU?si=3ckqHAce9mg_zzhA), and how does it affect the BA?

2. What is the difference between change management and organisational change management?

3. What are [scope changes](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/scope-change-management), and how should you deal with them?

4. How could change management conflict with Agile principles? How would you handle this conflict pragmatically?

5. Thinking about the roadmap you built, how will change management be part of your MVP?
