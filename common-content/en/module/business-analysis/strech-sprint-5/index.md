Do you want to learn something extra?

- Plan and prepare a **Retrospective** for your BrightStar scrum team. Consider that it can be a hybrid team. Think about the board, how you want the interaction to be, how you want to lead it.

- Read about **Roadmaps** and prepare a Roadmap for the next 2-4 product increments (a product increments might be one quarter of the year, for example) of your BrightStar solution
