As a group, work together to create and submit these key documents for a new business scenario. Each person should understand all parts of the submission:

1. A Problem Statement (what the problem is) & Stakeholder Map (who is involved).
2. 2-3 User Personas (descriptions of typical users).
3. An "As-Is" Process or User Journey Diagram (how things currently work).
4. 8-10 Requirements (what the solution needs to do, functional, non-functional).
5. 5 User Stories with acceptance criteria.
6. A high-level Solution Design (how you'd solve the problem).
7. What's "In-Scope" (what you will do) and "Out-of-Scope" (what you won't do for this project)?
