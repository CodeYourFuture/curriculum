Now let’s try and apply our knowledge of Agile business analysis in the BrightStar project:

1. Prepare an initial **backlog** for Brightstar (5-20 backlog items, depending on the level of detail. You may use Epic, Feature and Story types of backlog items.)  
Use GitHub projects to document this.  
  _This [GitHub page](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) explains more details. You can use the Milestone feature as an Epic._

2. Read about [prioritisation techniques](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/prioritization-framework#:~:text=A%20product%20prioritization%20framework%20is,what%20to%20work%20on%20next.) and describe how you would approach **setting priorities** for your backlog items. 

3. Formulate a **Definition of Ready** for the BrightStar product development process

4. Describe how you would go about **setting sprint goals** and how you would reflect these decisions in the backlog

5. Describe the **MVP** for your planned BrightStar development

6. Formulate a **Definition of Done** for backlog items
Consider how you would measure the success of your initial deliverables, using [OKR/KPI](https://agilemania.com/difference-between-okr-vs-kpi#:~:text=OKRs%20involve%20setting%20new%20objectives,collaborate%20on%20defining%20relevant%20KPIs.) where relevant

7. Consider how feedback from your sprint deliverables would affect your prioritisation and goal setting for later sprints
