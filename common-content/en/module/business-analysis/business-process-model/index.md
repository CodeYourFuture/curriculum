Learn about business process modelling and notations used for this (eg, BPMN, UML). You can do the [Udemy crash course](https://codeyourfuture.udemy.com/course/business-process-mapping-and-modelling-crash-course/) for BPMN, and then refer to this [page here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tutorial/bpmn) to understand the syntax of each notations (events, activity, artifact types).

You can also refer to this page to understand the differences between BPMN & UML in [this article](https://miro.com/diagramming/bpmn-vs-uml/).

1. Create a simple business process model for one existing business process within BrightStar
2. Use swimlanes within the model to show where the responsibility for carrying out individual steps lies, taking care that swimlanes represent organisational units (organisation, department, role) and not systems
