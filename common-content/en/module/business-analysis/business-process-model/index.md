Learn about business process modelling and notations used for this (eg, BPMN, UML). You can do the [Udemy crash course](https://codeyourfuture.udemy.com/course/business-process-mapping-and-modelling-crash-course/) for BPMN and understand the differences in [this article](https://miro.com/diagramming/bpmn-vs-uml/).

1. Create a simple business process model for one existing business process within BrightStar
2. Use swimlanes within the model to show where the responsibility for carrying out individual steps lies, taking care that swimlanes represent organisational units (organisation, department, role) and not systems
