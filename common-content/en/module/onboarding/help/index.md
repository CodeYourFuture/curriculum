ðŸ§­ _Everyone_ at {{<our-name>}} has barriers to education, and we can [help with some things](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/). If you cannot come to an in-person class because you can't afford:

#### ðŸ§’ Childcare

The onboarding module can be completed entirely online if necessary. Once you have completed this module and enrolled as a Trainee, we can help you with childcare costs.

#### ðŸ’» A computer or broadband

The onboarding module can be completed entirely on a library computer. Once you have completed this module and enrolled as a Trainee, we can lend you a laptop and data if you need them.

#### ðŸšŒ Bus or train tickets

Just like ITD, this onboarding module can be completed entirely online if necessary. Once you have completed this module and enrolled as a Trainee, we can help with travel costs.

#### ðŸ¥ª Food

will always be provided in class.

We ask that you complete the onboarding module step before we enroll you as a Trainee. We are obliged to only enroll people we have a reasonable expectation of being able to complete the whole course. But predicting the future is a challenge! We have created this module to try to give as many people as possible a fair chance to show they can do this.
