_Everyone_ at MigraCode has barriers to education. We can help with some things, and can recommend where to get help with others. 

The support _we_ can offer is around your ability to come to class, or follow the course material. We can support you financially with the following things for the first 5 weeks of ITP. In this time, we expect you to enroll as a trainee - after 5 weeks, we can only continue supporting enrolled trainees.

#### ðŸ’» A computer

At MigraCode we can lend you a laptop if needed in order to do our bootcamp. 

{{</note>}}

We ask that you complete the onboarding module step before we enrol you as a Trainee. We are obliged to only enrol people we have a reasonable expectation of being able to complete the whole course. But predicting the future is a challenge! We have created this module to try to give as many people as possible a fair chance to show they can do this.

We all help each other at MigraCode. We are a community.

You are not competing against each other for a limited number of places. Anyone who meets the success criteria can graduate with us.

- You should ask for help
- You should help others
