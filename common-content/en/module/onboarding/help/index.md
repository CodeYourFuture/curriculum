ðŸ§­ _Everyone_ at {{<our-name>}} has barriers to education, and we can [help with some things](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/). If you cannot come to an in-person class because you can't afford:

Help is provided to anyone who needs it in the first 5 weeks of the ITP Course. After 5 weeks, it is only provided to those who enrolled as trainees. 

#### ðŸ§’ Childcare

We can help you with childcare costs for the class and to study during the week. Follow the steps on our [Signpost](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/) website.

#### ðŸšŒ Bus or train tickets

We expect you to come to class every Saturday. We can help with travel costs if you need it.

#### ðŸ’» Broadband

We can help you with data access if you need support with it. 

#### ðŸ¥ª Food

It will always be provided in class.

For help with a computer, you must be enrolled as a trainee.
#### ðŸ’» A computer

The onboarding module can be completed entirely on a library computer. Once you have completed this module and enrolled as a Trainee, we can lend you a laptop if you need. 

We ask that you complete the onboarding module step before we enrol you as a Trainee. We are obliged to only enrol people we have a reasonable expectation of being able to complete the whole course. But predicting the future is a challenge! We have created this module to try to give as many people as possible a fair chance to show they can do this.
