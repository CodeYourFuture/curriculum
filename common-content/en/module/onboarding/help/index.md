_Everyone_ at {{<our-name>}} has barriers to education. We can help with some things, and can recommend where to get help with others. Our [signpost website](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/) has more details.

The support _we_ can offer is around your ability to come to class, or follow the course material. We can support you financially with the following things for the first 5 weeks of ITP. In this time, we expect you to enroll as a trainee - after 5 weeks, we can only continue supporting enrolled trainees.

If you cannot come to an in-person class because you can't afford:

#### 🧒 Childcare

We can help you with childcare costs for the class and to study during the week. See our [childcare expense policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuPLflvuSED3XczbzGzgj2utwzXbWP-fxKMkqLaqHo4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qihtqi7x4bva) for more details.

#### 🚌 Bus or train tickets

We expect you to come to class every Saturday. We can help with travel costs if you need it. See our [travel expense policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuPLflvuSED3XczbzGzgj2utwzXbWP-fxKMkqLaqHo4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.aa4ef4mrh55x) for details.

#### 💻 Broadband

We can help you with data access if you need support with it. See our [internet access expense policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UuPLflvuSED3XczbzGzgj2utwzXbWP-fxKMkqLaqHo4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.obj7zunadec0) for more details.

#### 🥪 Food

It will always be provided in class.

{{<note type="Borrowing a computer">}}

If you need a computer, you must be enrolled as a trainee before we can help you.

#### 💻 A computer

The onboarding module can be completed entirely on a library computer. Once you have completed this module and enrolled as a Trainee, we can lend you a laptop if you need. 

{{</note>}}

We ask that you complete the onboarding module step before we enrol you as a Trainee. We are obliged to only enrol people we have a reasonable expectation of being able to complete the whole course. But predicting the future is a challenge! We have created this module to try to give as many people as possible a fair chance to show they can do this.

{{<multiple-choice
  question="Who will help you with your blockers?"
  answers="Nobody, I must do everything myself | Only volunteers can help me | We all help each other in our community"
  feedback="No, we work in teams. | No, your team can help you too. | Yes, a quality professional builds understanding by asking and answering good questions."

{{<note type="tip" title="Remember">}}

We all help each other at {{<our-name>}}. We are a community.

You are not competing against each other for a limited number of places. We will accept everyone who meets the success criteria.

- You should ask for help
- You should help others
