Writing information down helps you learn.

Writing helps you process what you're reading more than just reading it. Keeping notes also gives you a reference you can check. It can also help you plan, and remember to come back to things.

The curriculum will often tell you to write something in your notebook. You can do this however you want - on paper in a physical notebook, in a Google Doc, in a specialised application like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or however works for you.

We recommend you keep notes as you go through the course and learn.
