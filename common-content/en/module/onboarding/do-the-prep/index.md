You should have completed the prep listed in [Welcome to CodeYourFuture](/welcome/prep). If you haven't done that yet, go back and complete it now.

> 🧠 You must always do the prep.

If you have worked through the Welcome prep, begin the prep for the first Onboarding sprint (which starts here!).

{{<multiple-choice
  question="Where do you start with a new module?"
  answers="Just randomly pick something from the backlog | Do nothing and wait to be told in class | I should start with the prep for the first module"
  feedback="No, the prep will show you HOW to complete the backlog, so do it first | Nope, you're being told right now | Yes, you should always start with the prep"
