You should have completed the prep listed in [Welcome to CodeYourFuture](/welcome/prep). If you haven't done that yet, go back and complete it now.

> ðŸ§  You must always do the prep.

If you have worked through the Welcome prep, move on to [Onboarding Sprint 1 Prep](onboarding/sprints/1/prep/) and begin the prep for the first sprint.
