You should have completed the prep listed in [Welcome to MigraCode Barcelona](/welcome/prep). If you haven't done that yet, go back and complete it now.

> 🧠 You must always do the prep.

If you have worked through the Welcome prep, move on to [Onboarding Sprint 1 Prep](onboarding/sprints/1/prep/) and begin the prep for the first sprint.

{{<multiple-choice

  feedback="No, the prep will show you HOW to complete the backlog, so do it first | Nope, you're being told right now | Yes, you should always start with the prep"
