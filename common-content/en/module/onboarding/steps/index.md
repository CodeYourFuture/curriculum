Your goal for this sprint is to submit your first step and enrol as a Trainee. This is a big milestone, and we want to make sure you have all the support you need to get there. _You must enrol as a trainee during this module. If you have not enrolled by week 6 you will be removed from this course and can restart in the next ITP._

All the information you need to complete this step is in the prep. Make sure to read it carefully. If you have something blocking you from submitting, use this time to resolve your blocker and submit your step.
