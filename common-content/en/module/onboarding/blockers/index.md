We call problems that stop our progress "blockers". We talk through our blockers regularly and help each other get "unblocked" or "unstuck".

{{<note title="Sharing Our Blockers" type="activity">}}
Join the online board or grab some sticky notes. Add your blockers.

Make sure to add only one blocker per note.

{{</note>}}

**Facilitator** Once everyone has added their blockers, group similar blockers together.

**Facilitator** Next, discuss the blockers and help each other get "unblocked". Start with the most common blocker and work your way down the list.

#### Hints and Tips

</summary>

{{<note title="Example Blockers" type="example">}}

- I can't find a Slack channel people keep mentioning.
- People tell me I should be replying to a Slack message in a thread, and I don't know how.
- I can't open a PR, because...
- How do I fix extra stray files in my PR?
- I don't have a computer so I can't complete my work!
- How do I run Lighthouse?

{{</note>}}

- Everyone should have blockers. If you aren't blocked on anything in the course, do you need to challenge yourself more?
- Ask "stupid" questions. Your question is not stupid! What we are doing is hard, and everyone has questions. If you're stuck, it's likely that someone else is too. Please help others and ask your question!
- If you have other more _advanced_ questions, do write them on the board but **don't** expect to answer them in Blockers. We will work on those in study group.
