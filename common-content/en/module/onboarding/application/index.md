### Welcome

To take this course you must have completed [Intro to Digital](https://itd.codeyourfuture.io) and received a micro-credential badge by email. Check your email. This badge is your ticket to access this course.

You will receive an email within two weeks of completing ITD, inviting you to begin this course as a Learner. All operational details should be linked in this email. If you have not received an email, please tell us at contact@codeyourfuture.io.

Log in to your [Course Portal](https://application-process.codeyourfuture.io/). This the same portal you used to complete ITD. A new set of steps should have appeared. These are the steps to complete ITP.

If you are all signed up and logged in, please now continue...
