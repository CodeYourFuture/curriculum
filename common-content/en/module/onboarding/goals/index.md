You have joined us as a Learner. Your overall goal for this module is to understand how to succeed at the ITP course.

To demonstrate you know how to succeed at the course, you should apply to enroll as a Trainee within the next three weeks. To do this, you will need to do show up every week, learn, get work done, and get your work reviewed.

If eligible, you should enrol as a Trainee within the next three weeks. _If you do not enrol as a trainee by week 6 of this course, you will be removed from it. You can request to restart in the next ITP course. _

**Find the learning objectives for the text you are reading now.** These are the goals for this text. This is what you should be able to do after completing this text.

**Now find the learning objectives for Sprint 1 of the Onboarding module**. We call these the "success criteria". These are the goals for the first sprint of the module. This is what you should be able to do after completing Sprint 1.

This formal structure might be new to you. **It is a way to help you evaluate for yourself whether you have achieved the goals of the module.** If you have done (and can do) the things listed in the learning objectives, you have gained the skill. If you have not, you have not yet gained the skill, and should keep working at it.

As we are just meeting this idea, let's go over them here too. The skills you'll learn in this module are based around these themes: version control, requirements and testing, code review, data, and scientific method. Write each of these themes down in your notebook.

To complete the module, you will need to demonstrate you have learnt these skills, and apply to enroll as a Trainee.

#### Version control

_By the end of this module_ you will have tracked changes to data (your code) over time with Git and GitHub. Your goal is to build a mental model of Git "trees" and begin learning ways to travel through files using the "time machine" of Git.

#### Requirements and Testing

_By the end of this module_ , you will have tested your work using acceptance criteria, manual testing, and automated testing. Your goal is to interpret requirements and write code to meet acceptance criteria.

#### Code review

_By the end of this module_ you will have revised, refactored, and reviewed code using code review. Your goal is to form the habits of a professional who can think, talk, and write in a technical context.

#### Data

_By the end of this module_ you will have manipulated data with HTML, Git, and Google Sheets. Your goal is to begin to understand how data is structured and how to manipulate it.

#### Scientific method

_By the end of this module_ you will have written and asked well-structured developer questions. Your goal is to build a strategy to methodically solve problems.

#### Enrollment

_By the end of this module_ you will have enrolled as a Trainee. Your goal is to complete the onboarding process and enrol as a Trainee.
