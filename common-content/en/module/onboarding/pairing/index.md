- Switch between driver and navigator roles after {{<timer>}}10{{</timer>}}
- The "driver" is the person typing on the keyboard, just thinking about what needs to be written
- The "navigator" reviews what the driver is doing and is thinking about to write next
- Don't dominate - this is teamwork

⌛ Time's up! Take a {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} break! Make a cup of tea. Good job, partners!
