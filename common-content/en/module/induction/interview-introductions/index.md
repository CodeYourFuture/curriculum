Almost every job interview will require you to introduce yourself. This usually happens towards the beginning of the interview when the interviewer asks you a question such as ‚ÄúTell me about yourself?‚Äù. Being able to answer this question effectively is a crucial employability skill. It's your chance to sell yourself and make an amazing first impressions. Like many interview questions, this question needs to be handled in a certain way.

Your introduction should be short but not too short, ideally around 1-2 minutes. 

You don't need to give a summary of your whole CV or explain the finer details of your favorite project. It should be a sales pitch that tells the interviewer the exact things that make you perfect for this role. It can be easy to go off on a tangent when you're nervous so make a plan and stick to it.

Being too concise is a problem too. This is an opportunity to really sell yourself. Answering this question with just a few sentences wastes that opportunity.

It's important to match the introduction to the job. This means emphasizing the skills, experiences & interests that make you perfect for it. It is good to have a stock introduction but it will need tweaking for different jobs.

It's also important to show your passion for the job. The IT jobs market is very competitive. Showing that you are incredibly passionate could be a unique selling point for you.

One way of structuring this is by using the Present-Past-Future model:

- Present: Start by briefly mentioning your current role or what you are doing at the moment (eduation, job, etc.). Give an overview of your responsibilities.

- Past: Mention your relevant experience, skills, or education. Focus on achievements and how they shaped your current professional identity.

- Future: Highlight what you want to do next and why you‚Äôre excited about this opportunity.

Start thinking about how you would construct an introduction for yourself. It may be useful to review some reputable external resources such as [Indeed](https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/interview-question-tell-me-about-yourself) to get different perspectives and see examples.
