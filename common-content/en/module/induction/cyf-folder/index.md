> Make a folder called `MCB` (stands for MigraCode Barcelona) in your home directory. Store all your work for the course in this folder.

You'll need to create a `MCB` folder to store your projects on the course. You can do this any way you like, but here we are using the terminal.

### How to create a folder using the terminal

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

For each of the steps below, you'll need to use the command line in your terminal.

Use this [cli documentation](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/) to remember terminal commands.

2. In your terminal, print your current working directory.

3. List the files and folders in your current working directory.

You'll need a place to store your work for the course.

4. Make a new directory called `MCB` in your home directory.

5. Change directory into the `MCB` directory.

6. Double check you're in the right place by printing your current working directory.
