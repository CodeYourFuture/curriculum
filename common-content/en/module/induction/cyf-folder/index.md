> Make a folder called `{{<our-name>}}` in your home directory. Store all your work for the course in this folder.

You'll need to create a {{<our-name>}} folder to store your projects on the course. You can do this any way you like, but here we are using the terminal.

### How to create a folder using the terminal

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

For each of the steps below, you'll need to use the command line in your terminal.

Use this [cli documentation](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/) to remember terminal commands.

2. In your terminal, print your current working directory.

3. List the files and folders in your current working directory.

You'll need a place to store your work for the course.

4. **M**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory called `{{<our-name>}}` in your home directory.

5. **C**hange **d**irectory into the `{{<our-name>}}` directory.

6. Double check you're in the right place by **p**rinting your current **w**orking **d**irectory.

> [!TIP]
> If you're working on a library computer, skip this step. You will store your work in your GitHub account.
