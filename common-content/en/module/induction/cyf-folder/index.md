You'll need to create a CYF folder to store your projects on the course.

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

For each of the steps below, you'll need to use the command line in your terminal.

Use this [cli documentation](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/) to remember terminal commands.

2. In your terminal, print your current working directory.

3. List the files and folders in your current working directory.

You'll need a place to store your work for the CYF course.

4. **M**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory called `cyf` in your home directory.

5. **C**hange **d**irectory into the `cyf` directory.

6. Double check you're in the right place by **p**rinting your current **w**orking **d**irectory.<!-- END-CYF-ONLY -->
