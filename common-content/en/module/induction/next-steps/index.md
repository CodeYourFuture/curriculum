This exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository.
We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission -  to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended — you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository.

## For students

In this section, we're going to go through a set of questions/tasks to clarify what we're going to do in the next part of the course.

Get into pairs with somebody you've not paired up with today and try figuring out the answers/solutions to the following questions/tasks:

1. Using the curriculum, locate the page setup page for the upcoming module.
1. Using the [curriculum website](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/), locate the page with the prep material for the first week of the next module
1. List the things you need to install (if anything) for the upcoming module.
1. Check you can find the backlog page for the Induction sprint. Double check you've copied all the issues from the backlog over to your Course Planner.
1. Identify all the issues with 🔑 icon that are marked as **Priority**. What does the **Priority icon** 🔑 mean?
1. Go to your group Slack channel and start a thread 🧵 outlining times you're free to meet up to discuss the prep work during the week
1. Which day ⏰ should you start the prep work for the upcoming HTML module?
1. Experiment with your project planner: can you filter by Size, Week 1, Tech ed, PD etc.?

## For volunteers

1. Locate the classroom planning board for your region (if one exists)
1. Locate the day-plan for the next week/module
1. Check the instructions and links on the **Priority 🔑 issues** for the upcoming week (both Tech Ed and PD)
1. In the day-plan for the upcoming week identify the instructions for any workshops and visit the repository containing that readme. Check the instructions make sense.
