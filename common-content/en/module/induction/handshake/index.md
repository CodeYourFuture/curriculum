A **handshake** is a check for continuity between two different parts of the course. In this handshake, we're going to check any important work done in the Fundamentals module is carried over to the Software Development Course.

A handshake isn't the responsibility of a single individual: it is your collective responsibility as a cohort to check that you transition smoothly between two different sections of the course.

## 📝 Checks

Here are some checks:

1. Double-check that the "XX X Rota" spreadsheet you created in Fundamentals is bookmarked in your new cohort Slack channel
