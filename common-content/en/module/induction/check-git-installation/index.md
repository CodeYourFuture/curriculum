### Git

You will use Git continually as a developer. We will cover Git in more depth later in the course. Right now, we will just check that you have it installed.

Open up a terminal and run the command `git --version` to double check you have Git installed.
If it is installed successfully, you should get a version number (which may not be exactly the same as this example, but should look similar):

```
git version 2.40.0
```

Otherwise, you will need to [install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) it or ask for support on your Slack channel.
