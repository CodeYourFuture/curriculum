How can we get a copy of an existing GitHub repository on our local machine?

{{</note>}}

In other words, we need to get a local copy of the repository which is on GitHub.

{{<note type="note" title="cloning">}}

We call a local copy of a GitHub repository a **clone**.

The process of copying a remote repository on to a local machine is known as **cloning**.

A repository on GitHub is said to be **remote**.

> 🎯 Goal: Clone a remote repository to your local machine

You'll need to clone **your fork** of the education blog repo.

Follow through the steps in the video "How to clone a repository from GitHub to Visual Studio Code".

##### 🎗️ Reminder:

- Use the URL for your fork of the `education-blog` repo when you are cloning
- When selecting the location to clone your files, choose the `CYF` folder you created in the [module prep](/user-data/prep/#create-cyf-folder)
