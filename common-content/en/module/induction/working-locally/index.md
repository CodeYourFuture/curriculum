We can also use Git on our local machine to perform similar tasks as we do on GitHub. So we need to address the following question:

> How can we get a copy of an existing GitHub repository on our local machine?

In other words, we need to get a {{<tooltip title="local copy">}}A repository on GitHub is said to be **remote**. A repository on our own computer is said to be **local**.{{</tooltip>}} of the repository which is on GitHub.

We call a local copy of a GitHub repository a **clone**. The process of copying a remote repository on to a local machine is called **cloning**.

### 🎯 Goal: Clone a remote repository to your local machine

You'll need to clone **your fork** of the education blog repo. Follow through the steps in the video "How to clone a repository from GitHub to Visual Studio Code".

##### 🎗️ Reminder:

- Use the URL for your fork of the `education-blog` repo when you are cloning
- When selecting the location to clone your files, choose the `CYF` folder you created in the [module prep](/user-data/prep/#create-cyf-folder)
