We use VS Code to write all of our code in the course. It is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and really helps you write great code.

> [ðŸ”— Download and install VSCode now](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> [!TIP]
> If you are working on a library computer, use the online version of VSCode called Github.dev.

The interface is mostly the same, but you cannot install extensions or use the terminal. You can complete all the tasks in the onboarding module without these features.
