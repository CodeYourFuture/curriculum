We use VS Code to write all of our code in the course. It is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and really helps you write great code.

> [!TIP]
> If you are working on a library computer, use the online version of VSCode called Github.dev.

The interface is mostly the same, but you cannot install extensions or use the terminal. You can complete all the tasks in the onboarding module without these features.

> [!TIP]
> But if you have a computer from MigraCode or a computer of your own please download VS code and edit your code locally there (github.dev is only an emergency option).
!["Github.dev can be accessed by pressing dot on any GitHub repo"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/856858/130119109-4769f2d7-9027-4bc4-a38c-10f297499e8f.gif "Press the dot while on any GitHub repo to open Github.dev.")
