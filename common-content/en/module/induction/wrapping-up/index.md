{{<note type="activity" title="Creating a commit - Figure it out 🔍">}}

📋 Double check the learning objectives from this section. Make a note of those objectives that you're still struggling with.

Now you'll need to **create a commit**.

You can use this video 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RSMBSzFuA to figure out how to create a commit.

We'll cover this topic in class on Saturday too.

1. Try opening your clone of education-blog in VSCode
2. Try fixing a typo in the `README.md` file
3. Try using the video to create a commit of your work.
