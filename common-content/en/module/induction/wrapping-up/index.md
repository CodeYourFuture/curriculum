{{<note type="activity" title="Creating a commit - Figure it out 🔍">}}

📋 Double check the learning objectives from this sprint. Make a note of those objectives that you're still struggling with.

Now you'll need to **create a commit**.

You can use the "How to commit changes and push them in Visual Studio Code" video to figure out how to create a commit.

We'll cover this topic often in workshops. Come to a CYF centre to work on this with a mentor.

1. Try opening your clone of education-blog in VSCode
1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch
1. Make a **new** branch for your changes
1. Try fixing a typo in the `README.md` file
1. Try using the video to create a commit of your work.
