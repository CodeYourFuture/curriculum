> a way to share the history of the project between different users and different computers

To share a project and its history, we can use an online platform called **GitHub**

In this exercise, you'll need to explore a **GitHub repository.**

You'll need to look around and figure out where to find different files and find out information about them.

**‚ö†Ô∏è You won't be expected to know what the files do at this stage.**

Go to the following link: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog

It will take you to a GitHub repository called **education-blog**.

Answer the following questions using the page linked to above:

a) View the **README.md** file. What do the instructions tell you?
b) How many files are there inside the `blogs` folder?
c) How many lines are there in the **package.json** file?
d) Find the file with the blog content you can see on the live site here [blog 1](https://git-demo-week1.netlify.app/blogs/1)

You'll learn more about these type of files throughout the course.
