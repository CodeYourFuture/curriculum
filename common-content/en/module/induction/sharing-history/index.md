{{<note title="📌 Disclaimer">}}
This exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository.
We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission -  to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended — you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository.

Earlier on, Ahmed and Naima realised they also need the following:

> a way to share the history of the project between different users and different computers

To share a project and its history, we can use an online platform called **GitHub**

**GitHub** is a platform where teams can store projects along with a history of their different versions.

By storing projects on GitHub, multiple users can gain access to the history of a project.

On GitHub we call our project and its history a **repository**.

### Explore 🔍

In this exercise, you'll need to explore a **GitHub repository.**

You'll need to look around and figure out where to find different files and find out information about them.

**⚠️ You won't be expected to know what the files do at this stage.**

Go to the following link: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog

It will take you to a GitHub repository called **education-blog**.

Answer the following questions using the page linked to above:

a) View the **README.md** file. What do the instructions tell you?
b) How many files are there inside the `blogs` folder?
c) How many lines are there in the **package.json** file?
d) Find the file with the blog content you can see on the live site here [blog 1](https://git-demo-week1.netlify.app/blogs/1)

You'll learn more about these type of files throughout the course.

> We can use the Github interface to explore the different **commits** (versions) of a project too.
