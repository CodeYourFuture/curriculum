If you do not have a computer of your own yet, here's how to complete your work directly on GitHub without a local environment.

Each repo on GitHub has a `.dev` environment so you can edit the code in your browser using an online VSCode.

You can go to this environment directly by replacing `github.com` with `github.dev` in the URL. For example, to open the [`Module-Onboarding`](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Onboarding) repo, you can go to

https://github.dev/CodeYourFuture/Module-Onboarding

> [!TIP]
> If you do have a computer, you should set up VSCode and a local environment. This is a workaround for people who don't yet have the luxury of a personal computer.
