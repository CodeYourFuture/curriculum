Often we want to take an existing project and start working on it independently. In other words: we start making our own versions of the project separate from the original project.

We can create a {{<tooltip title="fork">}}A **fork** is a copy of a repository that exists on Github{{</tooltip>}}.

When we create a fork on Github, the new forked repository gets a new url:

#### https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-demo-repo

```mermaid

    A[🔗 https://] -->|domain| B[📍github.com]
    B-->|username| C[👤 CodeYourFuture]
    C -->|repo| D[📁 cyf-demo-repo]
```

When the user EagerLearner forks this repo, the path changes from `CodeYourFuture` to `EagerLearner`.
