Often we want to take an existing project and start working on it independently. In other words: we start making our own versions of the project separate from the original project.

We may have a repo with the following url:
![lesson1-github-url-anatomy](lesson1-github-url-anatomy.png)

We might want to start creating our version of this project in isolation from the original project.

So we can create a {{<tooltip title="fork">}}A **fork** is a copy of a repository that exists on Github{{</tooltip>}}.

When we create a fork on Github, the new forked repository gets a new url:
![lesson1-forked-url-anatomy](lesson1-forked-url-anatomy.png)

1. Go to https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog.
1. Find the **Fork** button on this page.
1. Click on the Fork button to create a new fork of the repository and set yourself as the owner of the fork.

üìã How can you check you successfully forked the original repository?
