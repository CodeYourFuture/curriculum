Often we want to take an existing project and start working on it independently. In other words: we start making our own versions of the project separate from the original project.

We can create a {{<tooltip title="fork">}}A **fork** is a copy of a repository that exists on Github{{</tooltip>}}.

When we create a fork on Github, the new forked repository gets a new url:

#### https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-demo-repo

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "üìç domain"
      B
    end
    subgraph "üë§ username"
      C
    end
    subgraph "üìÅ repo"
      D
    end
    A[üîó https://] --> B[github.com]
    B--> C[CodeYourFuture]
    C --> D[cyf-demo-repo]
```

When the user EagerLearner forks this repo, the path changes from `CodeYourFuture` to `EagerLearner`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "üìç domain"
      B
    end
    subgraph "üë§ username"
      C
    end
    subgraph "üìÅ repo"
      D
    end
    A[üîó https://] --> B[github.com]
    B--> C[EagerLearner]
    C --> D[cyf-demo-repo]
```
