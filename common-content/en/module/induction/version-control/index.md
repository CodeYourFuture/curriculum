To improve their way of working, Ahmed and Naima realise they need the following:

> - a way to both know what the most recent version is
> - a way to know what the old versions were, and in what order (i.e. how they got to the current version, and what content they may have deleted that they may want to get back)

To manage the different versions of the blog project, they decide to use **Git**.

{{<note type="definition" title="definition: Git">}}

Git is **version control software** that allows developers to create and manage different versions of a project.

In Git, we create different versions of a project over time by creating **commits**.

A **commit** is a snapshot of our project at a particular point in time. You can also think of a **commit** as a particular version of a project.

**Commits** store the following information:

- what changed in this commit
- who created the change
- what time the change happened
- what the previous commit was

A typical timeline of commits might look like this:

![commit-history](commit-history-relative-dates.png)

{{<note type="note" title="Commit hashes">}}
Commits also have a **hash** associated with them. A **hash** is a long string of characters used to identify a particular commit.

A typical hash will look like this: `fec6909d6de23c75e77960986a9b6a7aee7feec7` but you will often see them abbreviated to the first few characters like this: `fec6909`
