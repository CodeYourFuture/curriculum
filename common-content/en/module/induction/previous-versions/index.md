This exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository.
We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission -  to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended â€” you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository.

We can view the different commits of a project on Github. This means we can see what the website looked like before, in previous versions.
