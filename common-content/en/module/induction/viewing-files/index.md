This exercise is hosted on the GitHub repository of our partner NGO, **Code Your Future** (UK), and **not** on a MigraCode-owned repository.
We are part of a European network where we share resources and support each other as we share the same mission -  to provide free, high-quality tech education to our communities.

The exercise works as intended â€” you are free to **fork and clone** the repository as usual, if required by the exercise.

However, please do not make any pull requests to the original Code Your Future repository.

Once you've got a local copy of a codebase on your local machine you can start to view the files and folders in that codebase. You can use a code editor like VSCode that you will have already used in your application process. This is a refresher to make sure we are all on the same page.

### Explore VSCode

1. Figure out how to open the cloned repository on your local machine in VSCode.

2. Explore the repository in VSCode and use the code editor to look at the various files and folders.

3. Try opening the Integrated Terminal in your VSCode window

ðŸ¤” If you get stuck on any of these exercises, it's a good idea to search online. For example, you could Google "opening terminal in vscode"
