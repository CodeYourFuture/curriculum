At the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from the `/` endpoint, it sends back the same response: "Yay Node!".

Try typing http://localhost:3000/node and see what happens.

However by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different responses for different requests. This concept is called **routing**.

#### What is an endpoint?

An endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after `/`. For example: `/chocolate` is the "chocolate" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a request. It's the end point of the resource path.

#### What is a URL?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as URL
    participant P as Protocol
    participant H as Host
    participant Po as Port
    participant R as Resource Path
    Note over R: (Endpoint)
    participant Q as Query Params

    U->>P: http://
    U->>H: www.domain.com
    U->>Po: :1234
    U->>R: /path/to/resource
    U->>Q: ?a=b&x=y
```

#### Create your own endpoints and send different responses

We're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember the `app.get()` method? To set up routing in your server, we need to repeat this method with different endpoints.

For example:

```js
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.get("/chocolate", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Mm chocolate :O");
});
```

{{<note type="activity" title="Explore 5m">}}

Add some code so that your server sends one message when the endpoint is `/node` and another one when it's `/codeyourfuture`.
