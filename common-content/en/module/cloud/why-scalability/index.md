- **Performance:** As your application grows, you'll need to ensure it remains responsive.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Proper scalability strategies can help you use resources more efficiently, thereby saving costs.

- **Availability:** Scalability ensures your application can handle increased load without going down.

### Scalability Challenges

- **Complexity:** Scaling often involves re-architecting your application, which can be complex and time-consuming.

- **Cost:** While cloud resources are generally inexpensive, costs can add up as you scale.

- **Management:** Increased resources and complexity require better management strategies.

#### High Availability

High Availability (HA) is closely related to scalability. It's about ensuring that a service is available as much as possible, even in the face of various kinds of failures (hardware failure, software crashes, etc.). While scalability focuses on accommodating more users, high availability focuses on providing reliable service to the existing user base. In many cases, these two go hand-in-hand because a system that scales well is often better equipped to maintain high availability.
