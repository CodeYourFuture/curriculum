Scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. In the context of cloud computing and web applications, scalability often refers to adding more resources or modifying the system architecture to manage increased load.

Let's consider a hypothetical social media platform as an example. When the platform is new and has a small number of users, a single server might be sufficient to handle the traffic and data. But what happens when the platform goes viral and suddenly attracts millions of users?

- **Database Queries:** The number of queries hitting the database will grow exponentially.

- **File Storage:** Photos, videos, and other media files will consume more and more storage.

- **Bandwidth:** More users mean more data transfer.

To continue providing a seamless user experience, the system needs to scale. This could mean adding more servers, optimizing database queries, or increasing the bandwidth capacity.

So, in tech, scalability isn't just about making things bigger; it's about making them more efficient to handle a growing user base or data volume.
