**CI**, or Continuous Integration, is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. This usually happens multiple times a day and is complemented by automated tests.

**CD**, or Continuous Deployment/Delivery, takes the code changes from a repository, automatically builds and tests them, and then automatically deploys the tested code to a live service.

These practices make it easier to catch bugs earlier and make deployments faster and more reliable.
