Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning your cloud resources through code, rather than manual operations or one-off scripts. Essentially, it lets you script your infrastructure, the same way you script your application code. In doing so, IaC allows you to apply the principles of software development, such as version control and continuous integration, to your infrastructure.

#### Why is IaC Needed?

- **Consistency**: IaC allows for a consistent and standardized environment, which reduces errors that can occur when infrastructure is set up manually.
- **Scalability**: IaC makes it easier to scale infrastructure up or down in response to demand.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure can be treated like any other codebase, enabling you to use version control systems to track changes and rollback if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Developers and operations can work together more seamlessly. Infrastructure becomes part of the application development process.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: By automating repetitive tasks, you save both time and resources, thus reducing operational costs.

### The Evolution from Manual Operations to IaC

- **Manual Operations**: Initially, system administrators would manually configure servers and other resources. This was time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Scripting**: Automating configurations through scripts improved the speed but still lacked standardization and could be hard to manage for complex systems.
- **Configuration Management Tools**: Tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet brought more structure but were often specific to certain types of operations.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: IaC brings a holistic approach, where the entire environment is coded, versioned, and automated.
