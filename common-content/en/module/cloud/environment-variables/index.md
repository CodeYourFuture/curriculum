In any development workflow, especially one that involves deployments, it's common to have configuration settings that should not be hard-coded in the codebase. This includes API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive information. GitHub Actions allows the use of environment variables and secrets to manage these configurations securely.

#### Github Environment Variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs that you can create and modify as part of your workflow. They can be accessed in your GitHub Actions YAML file via env context. For example, to set a Node.js environment, you can do:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production
```

And then use it in a script like this:

```yaml
- name: Using Environment Variable
  run: echo Node environment is ${{ env.NODE_ENV }}
```
