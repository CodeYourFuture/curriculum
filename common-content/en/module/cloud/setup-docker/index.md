### Install Docker on your computer

This is a requirement. The official website has decent documentation on how to do so. It will push "Docker Desktop" if you're on a Mac, and "Docker CLI" on Linux. Both are ok for us: we need the underlying program and CLI.

### Go over the Docker 101 tutorial

https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/

[Docker 101](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/) is a interesting tutorial from the official website to get yourself familiar with Docker. Go through it.

{{<note type="tip" title="Complete the tutorial">}}
Note that the whole tutorial runs on a Docker container locally. Don't stop at installing Docker and running the container!
