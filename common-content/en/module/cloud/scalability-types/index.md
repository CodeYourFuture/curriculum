#### Vertical Scaling

Also known as "scaling up," this involves adding more resources like CPU, RAM, or storage to an existing server. While easy to implement, there are physical limits to how much you can scale vertically.

#### Horizontal Scaling

Also known as "scaling out," this involves adding more servers to share the application's load. This is often considered more flexible but can be complex to manage.
