`sed` is a tool for replacing text in files with other text.

`sed` executes a list of commands on a file. The most common commands are to replace some text with some other text, or to show or hide or delete lines that meet some criteria.

Sed commands feature both a matcher (called an "address") specifying which lines to operate on, and an operation (called a command) to perform on those lines.

{{<note type="Example">}}
`sed '1,3 s/cat/dog/' some-file`

Address: `1,3` - lines 1-3 of `some-file`\
Command: `s/cat/dog/` - replace the first occurence of "cat" on each line with "dog"
{{</note>}}

If you don't specify an address, your command applies to the whole file:

{{<note type="Example">}}
`sed 's/cat/dog/' some-file`

Address: Not specified, so every line of `some-file`\
Command: `s/cat/dog/` - replace the first occurence of "cat" on each line with "dog"
{{</note>}}

Learn about `sed` from its man page (and the backlog exercises).

Some sed commands you should understand and be able to write:
* `s/cat/dog/`
* `s/cat/dog/g`
* `s/\([0-9]\)/only \1/g`
* `/dog/d`
* `6d`
