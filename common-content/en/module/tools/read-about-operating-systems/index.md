Do project 20 from How Computers Really Work.

You can do this on any Unix-family OS - you don't need a Raspberry Pi.

Note: If you're on macOS, `ps -eH` doesn't exist. You can use `ps` or `ps aux` to get a list of processes. To get parent-child relationships, you'll need to install `pstree` using `brew` (`brew install pstree`), then run `pstree`.

Note: If you're on macOS, process 1 will probably be `launchd` not `init`.

If you're on a Linux machine, do projects 21, 22, and 24.

If you're on macOS, pair up with someone who has a Linux machine to do these projects.

Note: Several of these projects may not work inside Docker or virtual machines, you need to actually be using Linux.
