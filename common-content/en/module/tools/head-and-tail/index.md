`head` outputs lines (or bytes) from the start of a file. `tail` outputs lines (or bytes) from the end of a fail.

Learn about `head` and `tail` from their man pages (and the backlog exercises).

Imagine we have an input file which has 100 lines.

{{<multiple-choice
   delimiter="~"
   question="What would the command `head -n 8 input` output?"
   answers="The first 8 bytes of the file ~ The last 8 lines of the file. ~ The first 8 lines of the file."
   feedback="Not quite - are you confusing -n and -c? ~ Not quite - are you confusing head and tail? ~ Right! -n takes a number of lines to output, and head goes from the start of the file."
   correct="2" >}}

{{<multiple-choice
   delimiter="~"
   question="What command/pipeline could we write to skip the first three lines of the file, and then output the next 2 lines?"
   answers="`head -n3 input | tail -n2` ~ `tail -n+4 | head -n2` ~ `tail -n+3 | head -n2`"
   feedback="No - remember each stage in a pipeline applies to the output of the previous stage, not the original file. ~ Right - tail skips the first few lines, then head takes just a few from the top of that output. ~ Not quite - how many lines does this skip?"
   correct="1" >}}
