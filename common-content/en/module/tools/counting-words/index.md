In JavaScript we wrote:

```js
content
  .split(" ")
  .filter((word) => word.includes(char))
  .length
```

What JavaScript calls arrays, Python calls lists. Arrays and lists are basically the same.

Googling for "Python filter list" suggests there are two things we can use - a `filter` function, or something called a "list comprehension". Some people prefer one, other people prefer the other.

Let's try out both approaches. We can do this in a standalone program, rather than in the whole word-counting program. This gives us a lot more control, and makes it easier for us to experiment.

{{<note type="Exercise">}}
Create a new file, `filter.py`. Start it with:

```python
content = "this is a list of words"
char = "i"

filtered = TODO

print(filtered)
```

Now fill in the TODO. First, use a list comprehension. Run the file and make sure you get the expected output.

Next, replace your list comprehension with some code that calls the global function `filter`. (`filter` takes a function, and it may be useful to know that `lambda` is a keyword for making an anonymous function in Python, similar to arrow functions in JavaScript). Run the file and make sure you get the expected output.

Now that we've learnt how to do the filtering, we can apply what we've learnt to the program we're converting.
