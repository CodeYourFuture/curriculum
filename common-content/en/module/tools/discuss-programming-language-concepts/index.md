This sprint you have read about programming language concepts in How Computers Really Work.

In groups of no more than 6, have a discussion trying to answer the following questions. Everyone in the group should contribute at least one idea to each discussion topic.

Volunteers should avoid speaking as much as possible - the trainees should be answering these questions as much as possible.

### Topic: variables and memory

What is main memory? What is a variable?

How does a variable relate to a memory location?

How is a string laid out in memory?

How does main memory (RAM) relate to secondary storage (a hard drive)? Why do we have both?

### Topic: CPUs

What does a CPU do?

What benefits are there to having multiple CPU cores?

### Topic: Functions

What happens when you call a function? Can you draw this?

What are parameters/arguments? Return values? Scope?

How does "the next line of code to run" move around when using functions?

### Topic: Classes

What is a class? How would you explain a class to someone who doesn't know what code is?

Make sure to discuss at least two real-world examples.

Make sure you describe the relationship between a class and an instance of a class (often called an object).

### Topic: Objects

Instances of classes are often called objects.

This kind of "object" is similar to, but slightly different from what we call an "object" in JavaScript.

What are the similarities and differences between these two meanings of the word object?
