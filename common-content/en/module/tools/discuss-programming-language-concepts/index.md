This sprint you have read about programming language concepts in How Computers Really Work.

Topics to discuss:

<!--
TODO: Make this block more prescriptive about activities
-->

### Variables and memory

What is main memory? What is a variable?

How does a variable relate to a memory location?

How is a string laid out in memory?

How does main memory (RAM) relate to secondary storage (a hard drive)? Why do we have both?

### Functions

What happens when you call a function?

What are parameters/arguments? Return values? Scope?

How does "the next line of code to run" move around when using functions?

### Classes

What is a class? How would you explain a class to someone who doesn't know what code is?

Make sure to discuss real-world examples.

Make sure you describe the relationship between a class and an instance of a class (often called an object).

### Objects

Instances of classes are often called objects.

This kind of "object" is similar to, but slightly different from what we call an "object" in JavaScript.

What are the similarities and differences between these two meanings of the word object?

### CPUs

What does a CPU do?

What benefits are there to having multiple CPU cores?
