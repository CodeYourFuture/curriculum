We often use libraries in Python.

Python handles dependencies differently from JavaScript, but it has similarities.

We've seen that in JavaScript we write down what dependencies we need in a `package.json` file, and when we run `npm install` they will get fetched into a folder called `node_modules`.

In Python, we write down what dependencies we need in a file called `requirements.txt`. It doesn't contain JSON, it just contains a list of dependencies, one per line.

### Virtual environments

To install the dependencies, we need to make something called a virtual environment, where they will get installed to.

First we need to _create_ the virtual environment. We do this by running `python3 -m venv .venv`. This will create a virtual environment in a directory named `.venv`. We could actually create it anywhere, e.g. we could run `python3 -m venv /tmp/python_modules` to create it in a directory named `/tmp/python_modules`. We tend to just use a directory called `.venv` at the root of our project.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is another example of a convention - you could name your virtual environment anything, but if we all agree to call it `.venv` then we all know what this directory is when we see it.
>
> It also means we can write scripts, or `.gitignore` file entries assuming that's where the virtual environment will be.

Next we need to _activate_ the virtual environment. We do this by running `. .venv/bin/activate` (yes, the command we're running is `.` with a path as an argument - the `.` is important). This will only activate the virtual environment for the terminal window we're in - if you're using more than one terminal window, you'll need to activate it in each of them.

Finally we need to install our dependencies into the virtual environment. We do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This is saying "Please install all of the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` into the currently active virtual environment".

After we've done this, we should be able to `import` any installed dependencies into our Python code. This will work as long as we have activated the virtual environment in the terminal window where we're running our program.
