`awk` is a tiny programming language for manipulating columns of data.

Learn about `awk` from its man page (and the backlog exercises).

Some awk programs you should understand and be able to write:
* `{print $2}`
* `/Ibrahim/ {print $NF}`
* `{sum += $2} END {print sum}`

{{<note type="Exercise">}}
Write down answers to the following questions:

1. What does the command `awk '/Ibrahim/ {print $2}' scores` do?
2. What does `NF` in an `awk` program mean? What does `$NF` mean?
3. Imagine you have a file named `scores` where each line contains a name, then a space, then a numeric score. If you want to use `awk` to output the biggest score, what command would you run?
