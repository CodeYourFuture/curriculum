`wc` is a tool for counting the bytes, words, or lines in a file.

Learn about `wc` from its man page (and the backlog exercises).

Some commonly used flags you should understand:
* `-c`
* `-l`
* `-w`

{{<note type="Exercise">}}
Write down answers to the following questions:

1. What does the command `wc -w /some/file` do?
2. If you want to get the number of lines in the file `/some/other/file`, what command would you run?
