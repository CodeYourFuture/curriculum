   answers="`tr -d 'aeiou'` ~ `tr 'aeiou' ''` ~ `tr -d '[aeiou]'`"
   feedback="Right - we list all of the vowels as things to delete. ~ No - the no-flag form of tr doesn't allow an empty second string. ~ No - this will remove all of the vowels, but also remove other characters. tr doesn't accept regular expressions."
