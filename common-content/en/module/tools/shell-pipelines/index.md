### Key take-aways:
* Most programs take some input, and produce some output.
* Instead of writing one program to do exactly what we want, we can often combine existing programs.
* Programs read from stdin, and write to stdout and stderr.
  * They write their main output to stdout.
  * They write error messages, progress messages, and other information that isn't their main output to stderr.
* We can pass information between programs using a pipe: `|`
* We can write the output of programs to a file using `>`, or append to a file using `>>`.

### Comparison with JavaScript

A shell pipeline is like a chain of function calls.

In JavaScript we joined together pipeline stages (functions) with `.`s:

```js
["Hello", "I", "am", "EXTRA", "happy"]
    .filter((word) => /[A-Z]/.test(word))
    .map((word) => word.toLowerCase())
    .sort()
```

In shell we join together pipeline stages (commands) with `|`s:

```bash
printf "Hello\nI\nam\nEXTRA\nhappy\n" | grep '[A-Z]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Initial[Hello
    I
    am
    EXTRA
    happy]
    Initial --grep '[A-Z]'--> Filtered[Hello
    I
    EXTRA] --tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'--> Mapped[hello
    i
    extra] --sort--> Sorted[hello
    extra
    i]
```

   feedback="Not quite - what are stdout and stderr for? | Not quite - ls only lists files that exist. | Right - ls doesn't have any files to list as output, but does have an error to display."

{{<multiple-choice
   delimiter="~"
   question="If the working directory contains the files: 'primates', 'fish', and 'monotremes', what will `ls | sort | grep i | wc -l` output?"
   answers="fish primates monotremes ~ 2 ~ fish primates ~ 3"
   feedback="Not quite - `ls | sort` would output this, but there are more commands in the pipeline. ~ Right! We list three files, sort them, search for ones that contain an i (fish and primates), then count the number of output lines (one per file). ~ Not quite - `ls | sort | grep i` would output this, but there's one more command in the pipeline. ~ Not quite - check what the grep command in the pipeline does."

Next we will learn about some programs commonly used in pipelines.
