Consider the number `10.3`.

> 🤔 "What is the nearest whole number to `10.3`?"

The process of finding the nearest whole number to a decimal number is called **rounding**. So we could rephrase our question as:

> 🤔 "What does the number `10.3` **round** to?”

## ♻️ Reusing instructions

We can add or multiply numbers with operators, like `10 + 32` or `36 * 45`. But there is no operator for rounding the number `10.3` in JavaScript. And we will want to round numbers **again and again**. We should use a {{<tooltip title="function">}}A **function** is a reusable set of instructions.{{</tooltip>}}.

We don't need to declare this function ourselves. JavaScript comes with many **built-in** functions, ready for us to use, and rounding is so common that there is already one for it: `Math.round`. Because a function is a _reusable_ set of instructions, `Math.round` rounds any number.

Functions usually take **inputs** and then **apply their set of instructions to the inputs** to produce an **output**.

{{<tabs name="Functions in REPL">}}
===[[Try it yourself]]===

1. Write `Math.round` in the Node REPL
1. Hit enter to evaluate our expression

The REPL output `[Function: round]` is telling us `Math.round` is a function.

## 📲 Calling a function

For our function to work, we need Node to read the instructions and {{<tooltip title="execute">}}Execution means the computer reads and follows instructions.{{</tooltip>}} them. Write the following in the REPL:

```js
Math.round(10.3);
```

Notice the `(` and `)` brackets after the name of the function and a number inside the brackets. These brackets mean we are calling the function. The number inside the brackets is the **input** we're passing to the function.

{{<note title="Calling a function" type="note">}}

**Calling a function** means telling the computer to read the function's instructions and carry out its instructions. When calling a function we can also pass inputs to the function.

{{</note>}}

`Math.round(10.3)` is a call expression; read this as:

"apply the set of instructions for `Math.round` to the number `10.3`."

If we type `Math.round(10.3)` then we get the result `10`. So we say that `Math.round(10.3)` _returns_ `10`.

A **call expression** is an **expression** which **evaluates** to the value returned by the function when it is called. So the expression `Math.round(10.3)` evaluates to the value `10`.

If we assign that expression to a variable, or use it in a string, we'll get the value `10`. So we can write:

```js
const roundedValue = Math.round(10.3);
```

or we can write:

```js
const roundedValueInAString = `10.3 rounds to ${Math.round(10.3)}`;
```

Both of these instructions **evaluate** the call expression `Math.round(10.3)` to the returned value `10` as soon as the call expression appears. The variable `roundedValue` will have a numeric value `10` (just like if we'd written `const roundedValue = 10;`), and the variable `roundedValueInAString` will have a string value `"10.3 rounds to 10"`.
