If you get stuck on any of the below or above instructions, please post in your class channel on Slack.
You probably already have this if you have done Fundamentals and HTML/CSS.

Code Your Future does not support Windows
{{</note>}}

If you have a Mac or Linux machine already, you already have a UNIX based operating system. All CYF-supplied laptops run Mac OS or Linux. If you have your own machine and it runs Windows, you should already have set up a Linux partition after Fundamentals.

If you have still not done this, you must do it now. We cannot support trainees using Windows. It takes too much time from everybody else. If you need help doing this, post in #cyf-ask-tech-stuff, or bring your laptop to a CYF co-working space to get support. It's normal to need help with this process.
