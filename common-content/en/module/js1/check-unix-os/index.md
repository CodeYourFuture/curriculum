If you get stuck on any of the below or above instructions, please post in your class channel on Slack.

You probably already have this if you have done previous modules.

{{<note type="warning">}}
Code Your Future does not support Windows.

We have found that we don't reliably have volunteers at class who can debug Windows problems, and they frequently come up, stopping trainees from making progress.

We do not support Windows so as to not waste lots of trainee and volunteer time. We have made this decision even though Windows is a popular operating system and has features like WSL which help to get experience with Unix.
{{</note>}}

If you have a Mac or Linux machine already, you already have a UNIX based operating system. All CYF-supplied laptops run Mac OS or Linux. If you have your own machine and it runs Windows, you should already have set up a Linux partition.

If you have still not done this, you must do it now. We cannot support learners using Windows. It takes too much time from everybody else. If you need help doing this, post in Slack, or bring your laptop to a CYF co-working space to get support. It's normal to need help with this process.
