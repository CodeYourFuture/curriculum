> [!TIP]
> Computers work by storing and performing operations on data.

Computer programs are built from many expressions. We must understand how expressions are evaluated to understand how computer programs are executed.

We can take an expression like `36 * 45` and ask what it evaluates to. If we know what the `*` operator represents (multiplication) and if we understand the arithmetic rules represented by the operation we can evaluate this expression ourselves.

Happily, computers can evaluate expressions for us.

**NodeJS** is an application that runs JavaScript programs. In other words, NodeJS can understand and execute programs written in JavaScript. One feature of Node is the **REPL**.

> [!NOTE]
> REPL is a special type of program that stands for:
>
> - **Read** - Users enter some code that Node will **read**
> - **Evaluate** - Node will then **evaluate** this code
> - **Print** - Node will **print** the result to the terminal
> - **Loop** - Node will **loop** back to the beginning and prompt users to input some more code
>
> With a REPL we can run pieces of code and look at what happens.

We input JavaScript instructions that are then executed by NodeJS. The REPL replies with, or prints out, the result of this execution.

{{<tabs name="REPL 1">}}
{{<tab name="REPL Activity Code">}}
Type each of the following expressions [into the REPL](#repl-1-1) one at a time and then press enter to check the result.

```bash
10 + 32
```

```bash
32 / 10
```

If you don't know how to do any of the steps above, then try searching for an [appropriate command](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-use-the-nodejs-repl) online. Searching for things when you're stuck is super important part of being a developer!
