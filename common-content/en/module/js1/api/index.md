With Jest installed, we need to figure out _how to use the Jest framework_ to write tests.
This means we need to look at {{<tooltip title="APIs">}}An **API** is a boundary between a programmer and an application, enabling a programmer to use an application‚Äôs functionality without being concerned with how the application was built.{{</tooltip>}} again.

API stands for

- **Application**
- **Programming**
- **Interface**.

We've encountered the word **interface** already.

But we can break down each word in this acronym to understand it altogether.

- An **application** is a program or piece of software designed to serve some purpose.

- **Programming** refers to the process of writing code or software.

- An üïπÔ∏è**interface** is a shared boundary between two or more systems.

We‚Äôve encountered several functions like `console.log`, `Math.round` already.
`console.log` and `Math.round` are **API**s.

`console.log` is actually implemented in a different language (C++), but that doesn't matter - its functionality is exposed to us when we write JavaScript, and we don't need to care how it's actually implemented or how it works.

Jest provides an **API** so we can write tests.
So _we have to find out about the Jest API_ to start writing tests with Jest.
