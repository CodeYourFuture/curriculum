Let's start a brand new project in a directory called `ordinal-testing-example` and create a file called `package.json` in our project.

1. Open your terminal and ensure you're inside the `{{<our-name>}}` directory you created earlier in the course.
1. [Make](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html) a new directory on your local machine called `ordinal-testing-example`.
1. Change directory into `ordinal-testing-example` and double-check your current working directory.

```console
% pwd
.../{{<our-name>}}/ordinal-testing-example
```

👉🏽 [Now create a `package.json` file](#start-project-1)

===[[🕹️ Create a package.json]]===

{{<note type="tip" title="Package">}}A `package.json` stores useful information about our project, like the name, description, and version. It is written in the [JSON format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).{{</note>}}

1. Create a `package.json` in `ordinal-testing-example`.
1. Make sure it contains a name and description.

===[[👣 Step by step]]===

1. Create a `package.json` file in your project directory:

```zsh
touch package.json
```

2. Add a name to it like this:

```json
{
  "name": "ordinal-testing-example"
}
```

3. Add a description:

```json
{
  "name": "ordinal-testing-example",
  "description": "An example application showing how to write tests using the jest framework"
}
```

We can continue adding more information about our project as the project grows. For now, double-check we only have a `package.json` in our project:

```console
% ls
package.json
```
