We usually write [the time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zkfycdm/articles/z44mqfr) in one of two ways: the analogue 12 hour clock or the digital 24 hour clock. The 12 hour clock counts up to 12: it resets at midday. The 24 hour clock counts up to 24: it resets at midnight.

{{<tooltip title="Conversion from 24 hour to 12 hour">}}

We use the notation "HH:MM". HH is our stand-in for the hours value. MM is our stand-in for the minutes value.

## üß© Stating the problem

Let's pose a problem: given any time in 24 hour clock, we want to format it as a 12 hour clock time. To achieve this goal, we're going to implement a function `formatAs12HourClock`.

_Given_ a time in 24 hour clock  
_When_ we call `formatAs12HourClock`  
_Then_ we get back a string representing the same time in 12 hour clock.

### üß™ Our tests:

I expect `formatAs12HourClock("09:00")` to be `"09:00 am"`  
I expect `formatAs12HourClock("14:19")` to be `"2:19 pm"`
