Earlier we defined a sub-goal to find a value for the hours from the `time` input. We've found that `Number(time.slice(0,2))` is an expression that evaluates to the hours from `time`. So we can write an `if` statement using this expression:

```js
if (Number(time.slice(0, 2)) > 12) {
}
```

If the time is `"23:00"` then the expression `Number(time.slice(0, 2)) > 12` will evaluate to `true` and the body of the `if` statement will be executed.

This `if` statement is implementing the following part of the diagram from earlier:

A{Check: Are the hours greater than 12?}

```

Before we worry about how we handle times in the afternoon, we can check that we've solved this sub-goal.

We can check that we are correctly identifying times in the afternoon by adding in our `if` statement (which we think is correct), with a placeholder body:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1,hl_lines=["2-4"]}
function formatAs12HourClock(time) {
  if (Number(time.slice(0, 2)) > 12) {
    return "Don't know how to handle times in the afternoon yet";
  }
  return `${time} am`;
}

const currentOutput = formatAs12HourClock("08:00");
const targetOutput = "08:00 am";
console.assert(
  currentOutput === targetOutput,
  `current output: ${currentOutput}, target output: ${targetOutput}`
);

const currentOutput2 = formatAs12HourClock("23:00");
const targetOutput2 = "11:00 pm";
console.assert(
  currentOutput2 === targetOutput2,
  `current output: ${currentOutput2}, target output: ${targetOutput2}`
);
```

If we run our code, we expect the current output of the `23:00` test-case to have changed. It won't be correct - the assertion will still fail. But if it hasn't changed, we know our `if` statement is wrong.

```console
% node clock-example.js
Assertion failed: current output: Don't know how to handle times in the afternoon yet, target output: 11:00 pm
```

Even though we _know_ the code on line 3 is incorrect, this was a useful step. It allowed us to run our code more often, and check that we're on the right track.

Now we can focus on just one problem - how to handle times after midday (i.e. fixing line 3). We don't need to worry about both detecting the time _and_ handling it.

If the output of this assert still printed `"23:00 am"` we would have stopped here and debugged that. Again, we could focus on just one problem.
