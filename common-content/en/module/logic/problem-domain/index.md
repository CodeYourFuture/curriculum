> The problem domain is a bounded space that contains all possible solutions to a problem. Everything outside the problem domain is impossible or irrelevant.

Before we can solve a problem, we need to understand what's possible. In [Twenty Questions](http://20q.net/) we start with everything in the universe, then ask questions to reduce our problem space. We might start with "Is it alive?" to constrain our domain to animals, then "Is it a mammal?" to reduce further.
