Welcome to Logic. For this module, we will get out of VSCode and build mental models we can use anywhere to reason more effectively.

### You will need

üìì Notebook and pen  
üß† Your wonderful brain  
üîç And you will still need the curriculum and Google, that's not banned, don't worry.

### Learning by teaching

In this prep you will build a series of mental models necessary for logical reasoning. You likely already know some of these pieces. We will start to build each model by playing a game. Pay attention, because...

In class this week _you_ will be teaching something. You will be explaining one of these mental models. You will not use a computer to explain this, but something else. This could be a drawing, a game, a conversation, or anything you like that will help you communicate the concept, except a computer!

### Mental models

1. **Deduction**: Reasoning from general rules to a specific conclusion that is _definitely_ true
1. **Induction**: Reasoning from specific examples to form general patterns that are _probably_
1. **Abduction**: Reasoning to the best explanation for all the evidence we observe
1. **Falsification**: Testing a theory by trying to prove it wrong
1. **Problem Domain**: Identifying the bounded space that contains all possible solutions to a problem
1. **Bisection**: Reasoning by reducing a problem space to the smallest possible size
1. **Binary Logic**: Reasoning with only two possible states (true or false)
