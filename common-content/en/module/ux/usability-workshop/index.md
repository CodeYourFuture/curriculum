The goal of this workshop is to help trainees understand the usability principles that enable them to create functional and user-friendly digital products.

This workshop is expected to accompany [the associated slides in Figma](https://www.figma.com/slides/UaetXlZZwG3VGYpdxd84Zm/CYF-Usability?node-id=1-177&t=jWgI37RMiLG5Z1pj-1) (passcode: `cyf2025`) - make sure to present them and work through them.

## Introduction (5 mins)

* Go through the agenda
  * The goal - what we will achieve today
  * What is product thinking - think product, not just feature
  * Let’s talk about usability - make things easy: usability in practice
  * Useful tools - tools that help you design better
* Explain the goal of the session
  * This session explores the importance of usability and user experience (UX) in product development.
  * It is related to the TV Project assignment, where students are expected to plan, design and code.
  * Understanding UX helps create products that meet users’ needs and deliver real value.
* Explain what they will achieve
  * Explain the fundamentals of product thinking as a key mindset in product development
  * Apply core usability principles to design effective and user-friendly experiences
  * Use UI toolkits to enhance the visual quality of projects
  * Apply these concepts directly to the upcoming assignment

## Understanding Product Thinking (15 mins)

Discuss in small groups for 5 minutes:

Given an example of building a food delivery app, what happens when it's built without and with product thinking?

<details>

<summary>Background for volunteers</summary>

* Without product thinking, the focus might be on adding more features such as a detailed map or numerous filters, simply because other apps include them or they look appealing.
* With product thinking, the focus shifts to user needs. For example, recognising that users often want speed and convenience might lead to adding a “*Reorder Favourites*” button on the home screen. This approach prioritises solving real user problems and delivering meaningful value.

Explain what product thinking is

<details>

<summary>Hints for volunteers</summary>

* Product thinking focuses on solving the right problems for the right users. Without it, products may look impressive but fail to deliver real value.
* Effective product development requires aligning features with user goals and needs prioritising meaningful, useful solutions over simply adding more features.

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise (10 mins)">}}
Open the [YouTube Movies](https://www.youtube.com/feed/storefront) website and spend a few minutes exploring it. Think about two key questions:

1. Who are the customers/users?
2. Why are they building this website — what problem are they trying to solve

Volunteers: Run the Kahoot quiz linked below.

Trainees: Join [this Kahoot! quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/cyf-usability-workshop/f5d496ab-e902-4403-87cf-e18918a88066) on your phone.

## Understanding Usability re-cap (5 mins)

Trainees should have completed the [pre-reading](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jJlzFt2l48cDHdwF7wo__m6mfCx0N1IFT0T0BZhpuLw/edit?usp=sharing).

As a class, recap the 12 usability principles.

Get ready to wear a UXer's hat and review a digital product!

You're welcome to open the pre-read while doing the following tasks.

## Review a Digital Product and Analyse Its Usability (45 mins)

Get into pairs and review the [YouTube Movies](https://www.youtube.com/feed/storefront).

### First task:

* Pick at least one feature or design element that follows one of the usability principles.
* Discuss with your partner why this is beneficial to users.
* Add your findings in [this FigJam board](https://www.figma.com/board/wfhPOxPJ5Y6fQEIdzOTE2e/CYF-Usability?node-id=2-2&t=7OHsKSCykkjGZfiu-4).

### Second task:

* Find a feature or design element that does not follow a usability principle.
* Discuss with your partner how this might affect the user.
* Add your findings in [this FigJam board](https://www.figma.com/board/wfhPOxPJ5Y6fQEIdzOTE2e/CYF-Usability?node-id=2-300&t=7OHsKSCykkjGZfiu-4).

### Third task:

* Pick one of the problems you found.
* Brainstorm and propose a solution.
* Present your solution using a simple sketch or wireframe, with a short note explaining the problem, the solution, and which principle(s) it follows.

## Share your findings (10 mins)

Two groups should share their solution with the class.

## Share the tools that help design better (5 mins)

The last part is to share tools that can help you design better and make the process easier:
