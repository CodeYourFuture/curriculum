### What is a database?

A database is a structured set of data held in a computer. It stores, retrieves and organizes information.

You already use databases in your everyday life! A few examples:

- The messages you send on Slack are stored in a database.
- CYF stores your name and email on a database!
- Your phone contact list? That will be in a database too!

What else you do on your computer and phone? What information is there? And where do you think it's stored? Write down five other databases you get information from.

### How do they work?

Most databases arrange data into **columns** and **rows**.

| column 1 | column 1 |
| -------- | -------- |
| row 1    | row 1    |
| row 2    | row 2    |

A **column** stores properties of the data. In the example of your phone's contact list, this would be name and number. What other properties does your address book store? Open your phone and take a look.

A **row** is a single record of this information.

| First Name | Surname | Mobile Number |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Tom        | Jones   | +447700000    |
| Ali        | Smith   | +327700000    |

Tom and Ali's details here are records in the database. The properties are listed as columns and the values are in rows. Each row is a new record.

If you've used tools such as Excel or Google sheets, you will have seen this sort of structure before. We'll take a closer look at these in the backlog exercises to do this sprint.
