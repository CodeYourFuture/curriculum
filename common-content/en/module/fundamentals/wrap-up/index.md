### Reflection on Fundamentals

We have worked together over these weeks exploring some of what it means to be a software developer. If you have [met the criteria](../graduation/criteria.md) you will now be invited to join the Software Development Course. Let's think together about what software developers really do.

{{<note type="activity" title="What do developers do (5 mins)">}}

Join the Jam board/grab some sticky notes and add your ideas.

Make sure to add only _one_ idea per note.
{{</note>}}

Mentors will now lead a reflection and then we will do our last retro!
