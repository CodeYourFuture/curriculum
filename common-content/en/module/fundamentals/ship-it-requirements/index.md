Now we will ship some code, because we expect you to ship very often at CYF.

You're going to be working on and developing your own projects over the Fundamentals course, so let's begin with your Personal Home Page. In Intro to Digital (ITD) you built a Personal Home Page to complete the course. Now we‚Äôll ship it to become a ‚Äúreal‚Äù website. When developers talk about shipping or deployment they mean turning the version that they‚Äôre developing into something that users can access.

It's important that software _works_ and that both we _and other people_ can _use_ it!

#### You will need:

- Your personal home page on Codepen
- An account with GitHub and to be logged in
- An account with Netlify, so [sign up now](https://app.netlify.com/signup) using the ‚ÄúSign up with GitHub‚Äù option if you have not done so already

{{<note type="activity" title=" Exercise">}}
You‚Äôll export your page to a folder on your computer, upload it to GitHub, and deploy it to Netlify.

### Step by step

#### Step One : Codepen

Find your landing page on Codepen and click **Export > Export as zip**

#### Step Two : GitHub

1. Create a new repo by going to repo.new or by clicking the + icon in the top navigation
2. Leave the Repository Template as ‚ÄúNo template‚Äù
3. Type in a name for your project. It can be anything, but 'personal-home-page' is probably a good choice
4. Leave the rest of the options as the defaults
5. Click ‚ÄúCreate repository‚Äù. Once it‚Äôs created it will take you to your new repo
6. Now click the link to upload an existing file, which takes you to https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/upload
7. Find your downloaded zip file on your computer, unzip it and drag the folder on to your GitHub web interface.

#### Step Three: Netlify

1. Log in to Netlify and follow [this workshop to deploy your site](../../../guides/deployment/netlify/).

2. üéâ Congratulations! You shipped it!
