We call problems that stop our progress "blockers". We talk through our blockers regularly and help each other get "unblocked" or "unstuck".

{{<note title="Sharing Our Blockers" type="activity">}}
Join the Jam board or grab some sticky notes. Add your blockers.

Make sure to add only one blocker per note.

Once everyone has added their blockers, group similar blockers together.
{{</note>}}

Next, we will discuss the blockers and help each other get "unblocked".
