We call problems that stop our progress "blockers". We talk through our blockers regularly and help each other get "unblocked" or "unstuck".

{{<note title="Sharing Our Blockers" type="activity">}}
Join the Jam board or grab some sticky notes. Add your blockers.

Make sure to add only one blocker per note.
