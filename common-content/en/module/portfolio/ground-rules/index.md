We're going to start off by defining rules and expectations for working on projects during this module.

### 📐 Ground rules

1. We go together
2. Do one project at a time
3. We will put in the time - 25 hours

### 🏗️ Projects

- We start a new project when everyone has finished the current one
- We can work as individuals or in groups
- "Done" means "Good enough to show an employer"
- 1 great user story is better than 10 meh user stories

### 🗣️ Communication

- Post a link to your deployed application by midnight at the end of every Thursday
- If everyone is ~done, we'll start a new project on Saturday
- If you're not done, LIST YOUR QUESTIONS AND BLOCKERS
- But don't wait until Thursday to get help
- We are flexible to people's needs: but you must express your needs
