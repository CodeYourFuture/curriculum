At {{<our-name>}} we expect you to demo your work to the class. You must have many opportunities to practice how to clearly and simply **explain your work to others**. This is really important for interviews and career success.

## ⏰ Timekeeper

The timekeeper will keep the groups on track.

Split randomly into groups of no more than 4 people. Mix up your teams. Each person will have 2 minutes to demo their work to the group. After the demo, the group will ask questions or give feedback for 5 minutes. Then the next person will demo their work.

## 🧑🏼‍🎓 Trainees

### 1. Demo {{<timer>}}2{{</timer>}}

You will demo something about your work to the group.

You will have 2 minutes to explain what you did and why. It's ok to show broken code or a system that doesn't work yet. Just make sure your demo is interesting.

### 2. Feedback {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}

After the demo, the group will give you feedback for up to 5 minutes. It's smart to suggest what kind of feedback you want by asking some "generative" questions. For example:

- I wasn't sure if it makes sense to try X. What do you think?
- I liked the way I did X, but I know there are other approaches, what did you do?
- I found X really confusing, did anyone else have the same problem?

## 💡 Tips:

- **Practice** the format of demos before class.
- **Keep it simple**. Don't try to show everything you did. Just show _one_ interesting thing.
- **Keep it short**. Two minutes is enough.
- **Explain** what you did and why.
- **Show** your code, system, or other artefacts of work.
- **Ask** for feedback.
