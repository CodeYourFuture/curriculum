Your goal is to complete at least one team project, four team workshops, and the assigned coursework. For each activity, your goal is to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Build a complete understanding of the work you have done, because you will be asked to explain it.

_Our_ goal is to find people who are ready to join a team and hit the ground running. This means we are looking for people ready to begin working as an IT professional within the next 8 weeks. This is why we are looking at your ability to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Work in a team to identify, manage, and _fix_ technical problems
- ðŸŽ¯ Document your changes in specified technical formats
- ðŸŽ¯ Explain your work to others in English

These are the core goals of the Track.
