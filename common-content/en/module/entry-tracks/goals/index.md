Your goal is to build two group projects and one solo project over the next 22 days. For each project, your goal is to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Build a complete project that meets the requirements, including tests.
- ðŸŽ¯ Build a complete understanding of all the code in your project, because you will be asked to explain it.

_Our_ goal is to find people who are ready to join a service desk and hit the ground running. This means we are looking for people ready to begin working as an IT professional within the next 8 weeks. This is why we are looking at your ability to:

- ðŸŽ¯ Work in a team to identify, manage, and _fix_ technical problems
- ðŸŽ¯ Document your changes in specified technical formats
- ðŸŽ¯ Explain your work to others in English

These are the core goals of the Track.
