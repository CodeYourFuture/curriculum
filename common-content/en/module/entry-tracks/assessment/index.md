The final class day will be interview day. You will have the opportunity to be interviewed and to be an interviewer at least once. We will use a hiring platform, [Evidenced](https://www.evidenced.app/).

The interviewer will ask you some pre-set questions. These will be shared in advance so you can prepare. The questions are designed to help you show how incredible you would be as an employee, so take the opportunity to shine! You will have 30 minutes.

The success criteria is listed on the success page. Read it carefully so you know what you need to do to succeed.

### Prerequisites:

Your interviewer will expect you to have a secure understanding of:

- The projects and workshops you have done on this course, including parts your teammates delivered
- Professional English at a B2 level
- A limited subset of concepts at a junior level, listed in the success criteria

Review these areas before your interview. Read over the day plan for interview day so you know what to expect.

And remember: the interviewer is not there to catch you out. They are there to help you do your best. If you don't understand a question, ask for clarification. If you don't know the answer, say so. If you need a moment to think, take it. 🌱

Interviews will be recorded so you can review your performance afterwards with mentors.
