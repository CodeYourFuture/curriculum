You will work with your team during the week. You will need to plan your work and track your progress. You will use a kanban planning board to do this.

In the backlog view there are some assigned tasks. Most of your tasks, however, will be created by your team as you work through the project. You will need to define user stories, test cases, and interactions as you go. You will also need to refine tickets as you develop your software. We've added some reminders and tips to help you work effectively in the ways you learned during previous courses.
