To implement the character limit component, we need to update the interface as the user types in the text area. We can outline a strategy as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit of 200] --> B[Step 2: Access the textarea element] --> C[Step 3: Calculate the number of characters left] --> D[Step 4: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

There are two times we may want to do this:
* When the page first loads we should show the _initial_ limit.
* Whenever the user changes what's in the textarea (adds or removes a character), we want to _update_ to show the remaining limit.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit of 200]
Initial[On first load] --> B
Event[When the content changes] --> B
B[Step 2: Access the textarea element] --> C[Step 3: Calculate the number of characters left] --> D[Step 4: Update the interface with the number of characters left]

classDef hidden display: none;
```

Steps 2-4 will be the same, whether we're doing this for the _initial_ load or a subsequent _update_.

This strategy gives us a rough guide for the road ahead. However, as we learn more about this problem, we may need to update our strategy.
