To update the DOM, we'll need to understand the idea of timers and {{<tooltip title="callbacks">}}A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and gets executed after the main function has finished its execution.{{</tooltip>}}.

```js
function printMessage(name) {
  console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
}

printMessage("Sally");
printMessage("Daniel");
```

In this example, we have 2 different parts: **function declaration** and **function calls**. We define the function `printMessage` and we call this function **twice**. However, sometimes we may want to define a function but have it _called back_ at a later point in time. Consider another example:

```js
function printMessage(name) {
  console.log(`My name is ${name}`);
}

setTimeout(printMessage, 3000, "Sally"); // <-- Call printMessage after at least 3000ms, with the argument "Sally"
printMessage("Daniel");
```

In this example, we define the function and call `printMessage` just once. However, we're also using a built-in function called `setTimeout`. `setTimeout` allows us to set a minimum amount of time after which a function will be called back.

```js
setTimeout(printMessage, 3000, "Sally");
```

Let's break this down this call to `setTimeout`. It is saying:

> "After at least 3000 ms, call the function `printMessage`, and when you call back `printMessage`, pass the input of `"Sally"` to `printMessage`."

Notice we're saying _at least_ 3000 ms because `setTimeout` guarantees a minimum amount of time: it doesn't say that `printMessage` muse be called _exactly_ after 3000 ms. In this example, we say that `printMessage` is a {{<tooltip title="callback function">}}A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and gets executed after the main function has finished its execution.{{</tooltip>}} as it is _called back_ after 3000 miliseconds. In the terminal, we'll see "Daniel" appear first and then after an at least 3000 ms delay, we'll see the console log of "Sally"
