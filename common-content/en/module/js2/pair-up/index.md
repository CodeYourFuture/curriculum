For the final week of this module, you will need to **work in pairs** to **build an application from scratch**.

Use this time to setup and plan your work together for next week.

## 🧰 Setup

1. You'll need to split up into pairs with someone you can work with over the final week of this module. Double check you will have availability to work together during the week.

2. Together in your pairs, you'll have 2 options:

### Option 1

Choose an app from the backlog that you can work on together _from scratch_. E.g. `alarmclock` app.

### Option 2

Choose a project brief from the from the dom-app projects section.
and

1. Read the project brief carefully

2. Create a user story for the chosen project brief and sketch out one acceptance criterion based on the description in the project brief. [This workshop](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/tree/main/breakdown) will guide you on coming up with user stories and acceptance criteria.

## ⏲️ Availability

In your pairs, discuss your availability and then agree on times to meet up during next week to work on your app together.
