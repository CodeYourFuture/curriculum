The `profileData` object is made up of **properties**.
Each **property** is an association between a key and a value.

```js
{
  firstName: "Francesco",
  lastName: "Leoni",
  age: 33,
  cityOfResidence: "Manchester"
};
```

In the {{<tooltip title="object literal">}} An object literal is an object defined by writing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs inside of curly braces.{{</tooltip>}} above, there are 3 properties. The first property consists of `firstName` and `"Francesco"`. `firstName` is the **key**, `"Francesco"` is the **value** associated with the key `firstName`.

In object literals, each **key-value pair** is separated by a comma.
