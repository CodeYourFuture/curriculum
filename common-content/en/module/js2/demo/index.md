Take this time to demo the application you've been building this week to the rest of the group (your application doesn't need to be finished!)

You can talk about the following:

- Demo the app and talk through its functionality
- Your problem solving strategy
- Any challenges you faced in developing the app

{{<note type="tip" title="Tips">}}

1. Keep your demonstration brief - under 10 mins!
2. Have both people in the pair talk about the work
