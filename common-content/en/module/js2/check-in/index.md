This week you should have been **building an app in pairs**.
Use this time to check your progress and identify areas/tasks you need to complete.

### 🔑 Key questions

You can use the questions below to reflect on your progress this week.

- Which acceptance criteria have you completed for your app?
- Have you deployed your app? Do you have a link to the deployed version that you can share with others?
- Is your code formatted properly?
- Is your code readable? E.g. do you have clear function names, variable names etc.

### 📝 User feedback

If you have time, get some user feedback on your deployed application. Share your deploy link with volunteers or trainees.
