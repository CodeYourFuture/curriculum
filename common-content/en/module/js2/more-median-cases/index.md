Try writing a test case to check `calculateMedian` works in the case when it is passed an _array of even length_.

Use [documentation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zwhgk2p/revision/2) to check how the median is computed in this case.

Once you've written your test case for `calculateMedian`, hopefully you see this implementation isn't doing the right thing. Try implementing the functionality for this case.
