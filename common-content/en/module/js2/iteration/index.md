To solve the sub-goal, we have to repeatedly add each number in the array to the `total`, one at a time. In programming, the process of repeating something is called **iteration**.

In programming, we can **iterate** by using a {{<tooltip title="loop">}}A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until some condition is reached.{{</tooltip>}}.

In particular, we can use a [`for...of` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) to sum the elements of the array.

```js
function calculateMean(list) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of list) {
    total += item;
  }
}
```
