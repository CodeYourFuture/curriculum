In the case of the ` textarea` element, we want to update the `p` element text **every time the user types inside the textarea**. In other words, we want our application to **_react_** to the **_user typing on the keyboard_**. Currently our plan looks like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit of 200]
Initial[On first load] --> B
Event[When the content changes] --> B
B[Step 2: Access the textarea element] --> C[Step 3: Calculate the number of characters left] --> D[Step 4: Update the interface with the number of characters left]

classDef hidden display: none;
```

However, we're missing a step in our plan. We need to find a way of running some code in response to an **event**.

{{<note type="definition" title="Definition: events">}}
An [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) is something that occurs in a programming environment that can be observed or responded to.
{{</note>}}

Events are things that happen in the browser, which your code can ask to be told about, so that your code can react to them. In a browser context, an event could be a user clicking on a button, a user typing something into a textarea box, a user submitting a form etc. Not all events are in response to user actions, for instance there is an event for the browser finished initially rendering the page. You can find a [complete reference all the different event types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) on MDN.

When a user presses a key in our `textarea`, the browser will create an event. If we asked the browser to tell us about it, we can respond to it. So we can update our plan as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit] --> B[Step 2: Access the textarea element] --> C["`**Step 3: Ask to be notified when a user presses a key**`"]

Initial[On initial page load] --> E
D["`**Step 4: When the browser tells us a user has pressed a key**`"] --> E[Step 5: Calculate the number of characters left] --> F[Step 6: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

Notice a few things here:

- There's no arrow between Step 3 and Step 4. The trigger for Step 4 is _a user doing something_ - if the user doesn't type anything in the textarea, Step 4 will not run after the first load (and neither will Step 5 and Step 6).
- _We_ don't run Step 4. The browser runs Step 4. In Step 3 we asked the browser to do something for us in the future. This is something new - up until now, _we_ have always been the ones telling JavaScript what to do next.
