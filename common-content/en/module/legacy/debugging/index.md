You have used this strategy many times before at {{<our-name>}}, and loads of [debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/reference) too.

With the application running, reproduce the issue by creating a bloom with the hashtag #do and navigating to `/#/hashtag/do`. Open Devtools and trace the request flow, just as we did in Navigation.

Yikes! As soon as we open the [Network panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/overview#overview) we can see the app is making many many _many_ requests!

**Prediction**: there's some kind of loop in the system that's causing the page to refresh over and over. **Explanation**: the network panel is showing a lot of requests to the same endpoint.

We can see precisely which files are involved in this request in the [call stack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack). This [stack trace](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/print-out-a-quick-stack-trace-from-the-console) allows us to reduce our problem domain to these 5 files.

```js
_apiRequest @ //front-end/lib/api.mjs:33
getBloomsByHashtag @ //front-end/lib/api.mjs:163
hashtagView @ //front-end/views/hashtag.mjs:20
handleRouteChange @ //front-end/lib/router.mjs:24
(anonymous) @ //front-end/index.mjs:44
updateState @ //front-end/lib/state.mjs:26
```

Remembering what we just learned, `Cmd+P` and open `api.mjs`, `Cmd+F` to jump to `_apiRequest`. This is a wrapper function that all these endpoints call, so it's not likely to be the problem if only this one view is refreshing.

1. Read `getBloomsByHashtag`. Is there a clue in here?
1. What is calling this function? Use `fn+Shift+F12` to navigate to `hashtagView`. **Prediction:** if we comment out the `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` call, the page will stop refreshing. Try it.

This should be a clue.

Our _expected_ request flow is:</summary>

<figure>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Expected Flow
    hashtagView->>apiService: Get blooms
    apiService->>Server: Request
    Server-->>updateState: Update
    State-->>Router: Event
    Router-->>hashtagView: Render once
```

<figcaption>

`hashtagView` calls `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` which calls `_apiRequest` which makes a request to the server. Success updates the state which dispatches a state-change event that the router listens for and calls `hashtagView` again to render the page with the blooms.

</figcaption>
</figure>
</details>

<summary>

But our _actual_ flow is:</summary>

<figure>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Actual Flow (Loop)
    hashtagView->>apiService: Get blooms
    apiService->>Server: Request
    Server-->>State: Update
    State-->>Router: Event
    Router-->>hashtagView: Render
    Note right of hashtagView: Loop starts
    hashtagView->>apiService: Get blooms again
    apiService->>Server: Request again
    Note right of Server: Endless cycle...
```

<figcaption>

`hashtagView` calls `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` which calls `_apiRequest` which makes a request to the server. Success updates the state which dispatches a state-change event that the router listens for and calls `hashtagView` that calls `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` which calls `_apiRequest` which makes a request to the server...

This is where debugging legacy code can be faster than a greenfield application. This application is _working_, and other views _don't_ have this problem. So we can look at other views, and spot the difference. In `views/profile.mjs` for example, we call the apiService inside a conditional:

```js
// Only fetch profile if we don't have it or if it's incomplete
if (!existingProfile || !existingProfile.recent_blooms) {
  apiService.getProfile(username);
}
```

This is _different_ to how we are using `apiService` for hashtags. Maybe this is intentional, or maybe this is a violation of a pattern.

1. **Hypothesis**: The `hashtagView` is calling `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` multiple times.
1. **Test**: Comment out the `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` call in `hashtagView`.
1. **Result**: The page stops refreshing... and is also blank.
1. **Conclusion**: The loop is caused by `hashtagView` calling `apiService.getBloomsByHashtag` multiple times.

Uncomment the line and don't make any further changes to the codebase. Move on to the next step.
