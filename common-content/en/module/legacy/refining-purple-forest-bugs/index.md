[The Purple Forest repo issues list](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-Legacy-Code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%3Agear%3A%20bug%22) lists a number of bugs that have been spotted in the current implementation.

For each bug report, discuss:
* What was useful in the bug report.
* What was unclear.
* What extra information would have helped you understand the bug.
* What extra information would have helped you reproduce the bug.

Run Purple Forest locally, and reproduce the bugs. Write up improved versions of each of these bug reports.
