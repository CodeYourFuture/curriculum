## Describe the Behaviour, Capture your Understanding

Now we have an understanding of the system, the bug, and the intended behaviour, we need to write a test to capture our understanding. There are some [Playwright tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) in the codebase already, but no project has complete test coverage for absolutely every eventuality.

Launch the test runner (look in `package.json` to find the command). Find the file to add your test and describe the behaviour you expect.

### üìù Activity: Write a test for the hashtag endpoint

```js
// Given I am logged in
// When I navigate to /#/hashtag/do
// Then the number of fetch requests should be 1
```

<details>
<summary>You might find this a bit tricky if you're new to end to end testing, so here's a test to copy if you get stuck.</summary>

```js
test("should not make infinite hashtag endpoint requests", async ({ page }) => {
  // ===== ARRANGE
  const requests = [];
  page.on("request", (request) => {
    if (
      request.url().includes(":3000/hashtag/do") &&
      request.resourceType() === "fetch"
    ) {
      requests.push(request);
    }
  });
  // ====== ACT
  // When I navigate to the hashtag
  await page.goto("/#/hashtag/do");
  // And I wait a reasonable time for any additional requests
  await page.waitForTimeout(200);

  // ====== ASSERT
  // Then the number of requests should be 1
  expect(requests.length).toEqual(1);
});
```

</details>

Your test should be failing because your system is making too many requests. This is a good thing! It means you have a clear goal for your next step.

When we fix our code, having written this test means someone won't be able to break this in the future without noticing. (If they'd written the test in the first place, we would never have had to debug this!)
