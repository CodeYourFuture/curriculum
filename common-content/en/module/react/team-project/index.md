+++

In this module you are working in a team to [build a React app](/react/product). (You should have created your group already.)

Take this opportunity to work with your team on your React app. You can use this time to work on your app, to discuss your app with your team, ask questions and get help with blockers.

You can use any study group time to work on your product.
