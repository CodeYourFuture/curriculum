To succeed at {{<our-name>}}, you must successfully deliver a team project, including a “Demo Day” demonstration. Successful delivery includes:

1. 🧑🏿‍💻 [Individual criteria](#individual)
1. 💼 [Project criteria](#project)
1. 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼[Team criteria](#team)

## 🧑🏿‍💻 Individual criteria {#individual}

You must demonstrate the skills description for [your role](/prep/#role-description) during your team project.

**You must write your code yourself**. 1:1 pairing sessions may happen at any point during your team project or beforehand, but your code is your code and you must understand it. You must be able to explain your code to another developer.

The kinds of skills you show in your project will influence what jobs {{<our-name>}} can recommend you for. If you only worked on frontend tickets, we can only recommend you for frontend jobs. We recommend working on a range of different tickets across your project.

## 💼 Project criteria {#project}

A successful Launch Project must meet these criteria:

- It works
- It is deployed (we recommend to [CYF's Hosted environment](/guides/deploying/cyf/), but it can be elsewhere), and the link shared with CYF
- The repo is public on GitHub and the link shared with CYF
- The planning board is public on GitHub and the link shared with CYF
- It addresses the project brief

## 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Team criteria {#team}

- The Launch Project trainees must work together in an Agile team.
- Developers must meet [the contribution guidelines](/sprints/1/prep/#contributions).

## In other words

> You have to build it together, it has to work, and you have to show us.

{{<our-name>}} has no automatic progress, but many chances exist. If you don’t meet these criteria, you can try again until you do.
