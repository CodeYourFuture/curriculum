To succeed at {{<our-name>}}, you must successfully deliver a team project, including a “Demo Day” demonstration. Successful delivery includes:

1. 🧑🏿‍💻 [Individual criteria](#individual)
1. 💼 [Project criteria](#project)
1. 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼[Team criteria](#team)

## 🧑🏿‍💻 Individual criteria {#individual}

You must demonstrate the skills description for your role during your team project.

These are mapped in our Team Roles: CodeYourFuture Certification Mappings [external]

[**You must write your code**](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/organisation/agreements-and-rules/student-agreement#1.-do-your-work). 1:1 pairing sessions may happen at any point during your team project or beforehand. You must be able to explain your code to another developer.

To demonstrate you are a full-stack developer, you must build features across the full stack. If you exclusively build front-end features during this project, you will be considered a front end developer.

## 💼 Project criteria {#project}

A successful Launch Project must also meet these criteria:

- It works
- It is deployed, and the link shared with CYF
- The repo is public on Github and the link shared with CYF
- The planning board is public on Github and the link shared with CYF
- It addresses the brief

## 🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Team criteria {#team}

- The Launch Project trainees must work together in an Agile team.
- Developers must meet the contribution guidelines.

## In other words

> You have to build it together, it has to work, and you have to show us.

{{<our-name>}} has no automatic progress, but many chances exist. If you don’t meet these criteria, you can try again until you do.
