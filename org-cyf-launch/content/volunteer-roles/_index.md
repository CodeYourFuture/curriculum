The Launch involves groups of trainees working together in a professional style on an open-ended project brief. They work to scope, plan, deliver, and iterate on a product. Trainees do The Launch when they have completed the [Software Development Course](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io), and we expect them to be ready to apply for jobs after this.

Volunteers join their teams in assorted roles to help support them, and help them to learn and grow.

As a volunteer, you will join a team for five weeks - four weeks of development, and one week of preparing and giving a demo.

You will be expected to give meaningful, actionable feedback on the trainees in your group throughout and following the project.

See below for the role descriptions:
