The Tech Lead will be part of an Agile Scrum Team supporting the developers on their daily dev work to deliver value to the users and organisation. You are not expected to write any code in this role.

The **time commitment is 2-4 hours per week plus Saturday all day**. It is a 5-week long commitment.

You can see [The Launch schedule and content](/) to get familiar with what will be expected.

## Who are you?

* **Developers with at least two years of experience in a mid-level that want to take the next step in their career** or **experienced Tech Leads**.
* Excellent problem-solving skills to break down the delivery and architecture/design of software.

## Your responsibilities

* **Being part of the Product Team motivating team members and creating a space where they can ask questions and voice their concerns.**
  * The team own their solutions, and it should be them writing all the code but you are there to support them with suggested approaches when they get stuck.
* **Being transparent with the team about challenges, failures, and successes.**
  * Giving the trainees honest and constructive feedback: if you wouldn't hire them, tell them why so they can work on it.
  * Make sure everyone contributes: the team has to contribute evenly, which will be measured.
* **Supporting the team to understand the requirements and approving the technical implementation solutions the teams come up with.**
  * Help with breaking tasks down into tickets.
  * Take teams through the agile workflow: Assigning themselves to tickets, creating PRs, getting reviews, merging and deploying code.
* **Oversee and define the architecture of the application.**
  * Help the team avoid getting stuck when building the solutions. They are juniors, and your experience will help them clarify how things should fit together, especially when integrating 3rd party APIs or setting up authentication.
  * Identifying risks that could jeopardise delivery.
* **Support the team as a lead**
  * You should not be writing or committing code, but you can pair or mob with the students on tasks where they've got stuck to help unblock them.
  * Incentivising the team to pair programme.
  * Help teams with merge conflicts.
  * Encourage teams to help each other as much as possible.
  * Actively participating in the Agile/Scrum ceremonies.
* **Ensuring the team is developing using software development best practices.** We are flexible around technology choices, but our trainees tend to know and use:
  * Front End Experience: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
  * Back End Experience: NodeJS, Python.
  * Databases: Some exposure to PostgreSQL, but little schema design experience.
  * Version Control: Git, GitHub.
  * Deployment Platforms: Netlify, Coolify.
  * RESTful Services & APIs.
* **Write an [assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sgNNJNsgWprh7VMCbiRgXY1BrqjzqxdWKKxSvTZwcjk/edit?tab=t.0) of every trainee in your team**. This must be done with the other volunteers in your team.
