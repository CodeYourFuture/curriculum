When designing and defining mock-ups as a team, we bring to life our ideas.
We discuss which one is the best and then define how we want to move forward.

With mockups, we can show stakeholders what the product might look like. Simple mockups keep it open for them to suggest changes in layout, images, colour, styles, etc.

2. Validate your mock-up with stakeholders, business owners or any available user
