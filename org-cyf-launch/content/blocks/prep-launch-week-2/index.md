The demo is done to the product team and various stakeholders. In our case, it will be to your cohort and all volunteers.

We expect you to watch all other demos and ask questions or give feedback.

#### The demo aims are:

- Demonstrate the _incremental_ progress towards your goal to all your stakeholders (other teams, users, volunteers)
- Share learnings and gather feedback from other people facing similar challenges to you
- Practice feeling comfortable speaking in front of larger groups

## Develop your presentation

1. Create a copy of [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TzlBcMQ9DdDoV_M6jiyvoozMShvQI1XvlUzWhzvysFc/edit?usp=drive_link)

2. Update the content on each slide wherever you see

3. Keep the content short (and sweet!)

4. Decide what you can demo. Something visual, like layout changes, are fine, but it should also be technical, e.g. “this is how we derived this value”

5. Decide who will speak - it’s important everyone in the team takes a turn

6. Practice! Your update should take no longer than {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}}
