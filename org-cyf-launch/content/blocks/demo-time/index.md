You have two main goals for today:

1. Make your demo in 5 minutes

2. Appraise your peers' demo, asking questions if you have any.

### Your demo {{< timer >}}5{{< /timer >}}

1. ⏱️ A timekeeper should keep time and call the teams in a random order.
2. 🪧 Make sure your presentation is up and running.
3. 🫣 Do some nerve-calming exercises so you feel more confident.
4. 😅 Smile.
5. ✨ Present amazingly.
