In the launch, you will build a fully working product in a team.

To achieve this, you will need all your professional development competencies: communication, teamwork, problem-solving, time management and confidence. So make sure you go through the points you know you
might need an extra reminder for and read them.

Your product must work. (Along with your business owner) you can choose the scope of your product, but what you produce must work. Remember: It's better to build something small that works well, than lots of things that don't quite work.

But to get you and your team ready for The Launch, there are other things you need to do, too, and this prep work will walk you through them.

Get ready to Launch your career!
