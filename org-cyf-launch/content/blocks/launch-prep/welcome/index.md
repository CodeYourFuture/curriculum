The Launch is the first of many products you will build in teams. To achieve
this, you will need all your learnings from the year of the professional
development competencies: communication, teamwork, problem-solving, time
management and confidence. So make sure you go through the points you know you
might need an extra reminder for and read them.

But to get you and your team ready for The Launch, there are other things you need to do, too, and this prep work will walk you through them.

Get ready to Launch your career!
