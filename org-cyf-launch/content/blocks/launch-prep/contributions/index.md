These contributions are expected from the trainees on the team:

1. **Roughly equal pull requests (PR)**: The team members should have roughly equal numbers of Pull requests each. We do not expect everyone to open the same number of PRs or commit the same number of lines of code, but we expect features to be fairly evenly shared.
   As a quick guide, in a group of four, no one commits more than 33% of the features, and no one commits less than 20%. These contributions will be measured with a tracker similar to [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vSSJgzCZJKF-2pwuBTkKjJJJ9i1CGRqMbYB-HEO5mo/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Full-stack developer = front and back-end work:** A full-stack developer must deliver features that touch each stack part. This means that, at minimum, you must build a component of UI that interacts with the database and configure and manage that entire process. At best, this means multiple features across different parts of the stack.

3. **Know how to do these:** create your feature branch, do a good code review, scope down your PRs, mob your paired commits, resolve merge conflicts, and merge your Pull requests (PR).

Make sure the whole team understand the [exit criteria](../success). We know it isn’t perfect, but it’s the best way to measure everyone’s input so far.

Find the template for your Launch group and add your team data.

If the template hasn’t been set up, do it yourself and share it with the wider teams.
