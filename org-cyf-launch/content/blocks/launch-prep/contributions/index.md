These contributions are expected from the trainees on the team:

1. **Roughly even number and size of features**: The team members should contribute roughly the same proportion of features to the project. Someone may make one bigger feature, and someone else two smaller ones. But someone should be able to look at the team and say "Yes, they contributed similar amounts". Because, regardless of feature size, you should be making frequent small pull requests, your number of pull requests should be similar. We do not expect everyone to open the same number of PRs or commit the same number of lines of code, but we expect features to be fairly evenly shared.

2. **Work on things you want to work on in your job**: If you want to be a frontend developer, you probably want to focus on the frontend. If you don't want to limit your job opportunities, you should work on the whole stack of the project. Most people should work on the whole stack (which can be within a feature, or in different features). The kinds of skills you show in your project will influence what jobs {{<our-name>}} can recommend you for.

3. **Know how to do these:** create your feature branch, do a good code review, scope down your PRs, mob your paired commits, resolve merge conflicts, and merge your pull requests.

Make sure the whole team understand the [exit criteria](../success). We know it isn't perfect, but it's the best way we have to measure everyone's input.

You will get instructions about what tracker you should be using to track progress on your project. If you haven't received this yet, ask for it on Slack. Make sure you fill it in.
