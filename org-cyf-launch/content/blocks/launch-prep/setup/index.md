1.  Create a GitHub repository.

- Pick one member to own the repo
- Everyone else should be invited as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- You can fork [a starter kit](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-final-project-starter-kit) for a basic project
- Make sure you have the [extension for Paired and Mobbed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichardKotze.git-mob) PRs

2. **Create a copy of this Project Board to manage your work** - [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/13) on GitHub

- Agree on which [columns](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board) you need (Backlog, Ready for Dev, Code Review, etc).

- [Link your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board) to your project board so you can easily create user stories.
