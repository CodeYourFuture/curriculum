### Create a GitHub repository

- Pick one member to own the repo
- Everyone else should be invited as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- Make sure you have the [extension for Paired and Mobbed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichardKotze.git-mob) PRs

### Make a project board for your team

If you want, you can create a copy of [this template project board](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/13) on GitHub, or you can make your own.

- Agree on which [columns](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board) you need (Backlog, Ready for Dev, Code Review, etc).
- [Link your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board) to your project board so you can easily create user stories.
