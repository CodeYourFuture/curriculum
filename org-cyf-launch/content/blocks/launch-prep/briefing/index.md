The briefing is a document that describes the product you should build. **You will be given a briefing on Slack.** It might be from a new partner, or it might be from {{<our-name>}}.

If you don't have your brief yet, while you're waiting, you can read over [example briefings](https://projects.codeyourfuture.io/briefings/) to get a feel for them.

### What you must do:

1. Read it by yourself
2. Discuss it with your team
3. Raise any questions before the start of the first week
4. Clarify the questions with the team

If you have one, the Business Owner can help you with this guidance. If not, you as a team will decide. Validate your decisions by asking clarifying questions in Slack to check you are still achieving the goal of the briefing.
