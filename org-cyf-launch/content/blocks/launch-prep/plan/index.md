You will continue working in sprints but with some extra meetings to ensure the team is aligned and on the same page.

### 1. Daily Stand-up:

- What? A daily update to your team and from your team to you about your workload. You will post a message every day and read all others, too.

- Why? Ensure everyone knows who is working on what or who is blocked and needs help.

- How? The easiest way is setting up a workflow/bot on Slack and everyone replying on the thread.

### 2. Mid-week check-in

- What? An online meeting during the week which all participants of the team can attend

- Why? Review delivery, go into detail on anything that could not be worked out via Slack or pair programming, re-plan if needed

- How? You can use Google Calendar and Google Meets or even have a workflow on Slack and use the huddle

### 3. Saturday meet-ups

In-person meeting with the following agenda:

- Demo: show what you have worked on this week

- Retrospective: review last week, celebrate and action

- Sprint planning/Backlog Refinement: refine the user stories that will come next and which ones you will tackle in the coming week

- Pair-programming: work together on the stories
