## Hello, World!

What use are plans without delivery? The most common cause of failure in the Launch is not deploying our code.

We need to deploy our project to a live environment as soon as possible. It is better to have something than nothing. It is better to have a simple version of your project in use than a complex plan that is only a slideshow.

Build the simplest thing you can. Deploy it. Get feedback. Improve it. Repeat.

As a team, you should deploy your project to a live environment **at least once a day**. This is the best way to ensure that you are making progress in manageable steps.

Deploy your project to a live environment now. It can (and should!) just say "Hello, World!".
