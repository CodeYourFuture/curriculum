The goal of this first meeting is to define what you will deliver as a team. When product teams work together, planning and preparation gets everyone on the same page. It means you might not be coding very much today, but will help you code more effectively over the weeks ahead.

Learning how to do this work will make you a better software developer and ensure you develop features that have value to your users.

{{<note type="tip">}}
It's important that software works and that people can use it.

Discuss and agree on the points below with your product team. Set a timer for {{<timer>}}15{{</timer>}} minutes.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. What is an [MVP](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/) (Minimum Viable Product)?

2. How can you avoid increasing scope?

3. How do we define what should be part of the MVP?

### Functions

1. What does it mean for your website to be interactive?

2. The product must be completed in four weeks of work. How can we make sure the scope is the right size?

3. Be well-defined: what {{<tooltip title="artefacts">}}Readmes, docs, diagrams, kanbans, user stories... Artefacts are documents produced during software builds that describe and illustrate its functions.{{</tooltip>}} can we use to ensure all functions are well-defined?

4. Visual design complexity: how can we avoid making our user interface too complicated?

5. Answers to questions: trainees are learning, so how can we, as a team, learn without giving each other just the answers - or expecting immediate answers from your peers?
