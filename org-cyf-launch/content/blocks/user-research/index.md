When we build products, we build them for someone to use. The best way to test that the features, design or functionality makes sense is by asking the user’s opinion.

However, don’t rush off and implement everything a user tells you. Use their input to amend existing features going in the wrong direction; add _new_ ideas to your _backlog_ for future prioritisation.

### Talk to users

Collaborate with non-technical stakeholders

#### Identify the users

- Identify between 2 - 5 users of your products

- Ask a range of people (of different sex, gender, ethnicity, etc).

#### The research

- Share the briefing you received with the user beforehand.

- Demo your product to them.

- Ask them: “What are your thoughts?” or some generic questions. Ask open questions.

- Make notes of their input and ask why they need this. Understanding the **why** will give you insight into what their problems are.

- Thank them for their time and ask if they could talk to you again next week.

#### The outcome of the research

- Compile the feedback

- Share it with your team on your Slack channel

- Define which changes you will make. These should become tickets on your board. _(Remember: not every feedback has to be incorporated in your MVP)_
