Everyone on a team must be able to contribute to the project. To be invited to join a team for The Launch, you must have

```objectives
- Kept the commitments you made in your trainee agreement
- Completed all your mandatory coursework
- Met your milestones (“At” or “Beyond”)
- Applied to join the project with your CV, cover letter, and a portfolio
- Built, tested, deployed and demoed 2 Products using a stack you learned on the SDC, where at least 1 project is completed in a team
- Passed the interview in which you demo the Full Stack Product. It includes technical and competency-based questions.
```

Your Launch Project team may ask you to meet some extra conditions to help you personally become more employable. This is at their discretion and will be set out in a Trainee Contract you will sign before the project kickoff.
