> AS A \[role], I WANT \[action], SO THAT \[outcome]

Set a timer for {{<timer>}}15{{</timer>}} and write user stories for the planning session. When raising your tickets, you can have two types of tickets:

- a **user story**, which is focused on business value (Format: AS A \[role], I WANT \[action], SO THAT \[outcome] + acceptance criteria \[rules/scenarios])

- a **technical ticket**, which is a step in the direction of a user story (Background \[why], acceptance criteria \[rules/scenarios]

1. {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} Discuss and agree on the first 5 or 6 user stories that need to be done. Just use titles to identify them.

2. {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} Work on 1 user story and 1 technical ticket together as a team.

3. {{<timer>}}5{{</timer>}} Now, each team member chooses one ticket and writes it. Think about clarity so that anyone outside the team can understand it, too. They will be discussed in the next session.
