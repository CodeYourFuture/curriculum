### Motivation

We have a lot of first-time volunteers helping at the Launch, so it is always good to ensure both volunteers and trainees understand what the module is about.

Discuss the following questions as a cohort (trainees and volunteers):

1. What have the trainees **learned before** joining the Launch module? Think about Tech Ed and Professional Development (PD) learnings.

2. What will be the main **challenges for the trainees**?

3. What will be the main **challenges for the volunteers**?

4. **Why** do we do the Launch module?

5. What should we make sure we **don’t do** at the Launch module?

6. What are we doing on the **Saturday sessions**?

7. How many **mid-week check-ins** should each team have?

8. What are the **common mistakes** made by teams?

9. How will you **deal with the conflicts** below?

   - **Safeguarding**: someone is at risk, and you don’t know what to do.
   - **Abusive behaviour**: could include [code of conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) violation.
   - **Disengagement**: a trainee or volunteer not participating
   - **Poor technical contributions:** The trainee is contributing, but the code is not good enough or actively bad; the team cannot deliver weekly releases

10. **Would you hire this trainee?** Why is this question important for trainees and volunteers to have in mind? And if you would not hire them, what should you do?
