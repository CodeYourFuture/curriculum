      Discuss the following questions as a cohort (trainees and volunteers):


      1. What have the trainees **learned before** joining the Launch module? Think about Tech Ed and Professional Development (PD) learnings.

      2. What will be the main **challenges for the trainees**?

      3. What will be the main **challenges for the volunteers**?

      4. **Why** do we do the Launch module?

      5. What should we make sure we **don’t do** at the Launch module?

      6. What are we doing on the **Saturday sessions**?

      7. How many **mid-week check-ins** should each team have?

      8. What are the **common mistakes** made by teams?

      9. How will you **deal with the conflicts** below?

         * **Safeguarding**: someone is at risk, and you don’t know what to do.\
           10 
         * **Abusive behaviour**: could include [code of conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20tolerate%20harassment,appropriate%20for%20any%20community%20activity.&text=Harassment%20is%20a%20form%20of,the%20Equality%20Act%20is%20unlawful.) violation.    
         * **Disengagement**: a trainee or volunteer not participating 
         * **Poor technical contributions:** The trainee is contributing, but the code is not good enough or actively bad; the team cannot deliver weekly releases
      10. **Would you hire this trainee?** Why is this question important for trainees and volunteers to have in mind? And if you would not hire them, what should you do?
    goal: Understand the Launch module
