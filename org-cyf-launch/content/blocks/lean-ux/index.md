#### Define your product and features

To ensure we can keep the scope lean and everyone understands the product, briefing and features the same way, follow these steps:

Work on this Lean UX Canvas on this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM-LblbI=/?share_link_id=993024794808)

1. Do a user story mapping (an example is on the same [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM-LblbI=/?share_link_id=993024794808), Exercise 3.2)

2. Define the features that will be included in your MVP.
